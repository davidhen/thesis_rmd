Given the broad scope of the research covered in the thesis, key findings and their implications are discussed in ? subsections. 

\subsection{Patterns in receipt of social care}\label{subsec:mm-sc-kfinds}

This analyses of patterns of social care use in Scotland is novel given its linkage of health and social care resources and has a number of findings and implications. The descriptive statistics in section \ref{sec:res1-sc} and the first set of models presented in chapter \ref{ch:res2} investigated the factors associated with receipt of social care. One important aspect was to identify if a relationship between multimorbidity and social care existed as this had been identified as a gap in existing empirical knowledge. The results indicate that such a relationship does indeed exist and that the effect of this relationship grows as the severity of multimorbidity (measured by grouped repeat medicine counts) increases. The change in probability of receiving social care for those in the highest multimorbidity group (prescribed nine-or-more repeat medicines) compared to those in the lowest group (prescribed 0-2 medicines) is approximately 15%. This change is approximately 6.5% and 3% for the 6-8 and 3-5 repeat medicine groups respectively.  

These results are broadly consistent across models applied to differing financial years of data. Subset 2 (including individuals from nine local authorities with a linkage rate of 92%-95.9%) showed slightly lower values of partial effects for all age, sex, and multimorbidity groups group compared to subset 1. This may be due to the larger size of subset 2 which included approximately 77,000 more individuals overall and less uncertainty for the lower numbers in smaller groups. Nevertheless, overall patterns are similar across both subsets. 

The use of partial (or marginal) effects to interpret logistic regression models allows comparison of effect sizes across variables and models after adjustment for all included independent variables [@RN563]. In both subsets of data, models across all years showed the partial effect of being in the highest multimorbid group compared to the lowest was of similar magnitude to that of being aged 80-84 compared to being aged 65-69. In other words, after adjustment for age, sex, and sociodemographic variables, being in the highest multimorbidity group is equivalent to being 10-15 years older than the baseline age group. 

The identification of the relationship between multimorbidity and social care use is important both for health clinicians and policy makers. High levels of multimorbidity have the potential to indicate need for social care which should be a consideration when assessing this patient group. Given the increasing prevelance of multimorbidty and the reduction in funding for social care (discussed in chapter \ref{ch:lit-review}), urgent consideration of social care provision and funding by policy-makers is warranted. 

This argument has further support given that social care receipt also has, unsurprisingly, an association with age. Given demographic trends, the demand for social care services is only likely to increase. Indeed, the only other measurements with higher magnitude of partial effects than the highest multimorbidity group were those related to higher age groups, particularly the three age groups in which those over 85 belonged to: 85-89, 90-94, and 95 plus. The magnitude of effects for these groups were particularly high indicating that, after adjustment for other model variables, being in these age groups was associated with approximately 29%, 42%, and 47% increased probability of receiving social care compared to those in the 65-69 age group respectively (again slightly lower effects were seen in subset 2). Standard errors were higher, and their associated 95% confidence intervals wider, for the two highest age groups than seen for other variables reflecting the lower overall numbers in these groups. Nevertheless, social care receipt has a strong relationship in age groups over 85 years which is likely to reflect higher levels of frailty. 

Unexpectedly, the effect of socioeconomic position, as measured by SIMD decile of residence, is negligible after adjusting for other variables in the models of both subsets. This is an important finding and suggests that the higher rates of social care receipt for those living in lower SIMD deciles shown in tables \ref{tab:res2-chars1516} and \ref{tab:res2-2-chars1516} are attenuated after adjustment for age, multimorbidity, sex, and local authority of residence. The likely reason for this can be discerned from the pattern shown in figure \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-1}. This shows that, apart from those in the highest multimorbidity group (9+ repeat medicines), the rate of care received in each group is more evenly spread across deprivation deciles - resulting in the small partial effect of SIMD decile in the models. This effect can be more easily discerend in figure \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-2} where rates of care \emph{within} each age/sex group are visualised.  The higher rates of social care receipt in lower SIMD deciles, therefore, are driven by those (particularly females) in the highest multimorbidity group. This would suggest care is concentrated on those with highest need reflecting the arguments of "intensification" discussed in chapter \ref{ch:lit-review}.  

Tables \ref{tab:res2-chars1516} and \ref{tab:res2-2-chars1516} both show higher percentages of females receiving social care compared to males whilst figure \ref{fig:results1-sc-demos} shows this pattern is consistent across all ages. Depsite this, the APE for being female is relatively small in models - 4% and 3.2% increased probability in subset 1 and 2 respectively. This suggests multimorbidity status attenuates some, but not all, of the higher rates of social care received by females - a pattern also visible in figure \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-2}. The remaining gap between sexes in social care receipt could potentially be explained by two reasons. Firstly, females may be more likely to live alone and therefore have greater need for social care in older age. Secondly, females may be more likely to provide, and less likely to receive, informal care to or from a partner. Whilst a variable for living arrangements is available in the SCS, there are high levels of missing data meaning it could not be accurately included in models. 

A final finding from the analysis on social care receipt is that variation between local authorities is also present. The differences in the probability of receiving social care of 6.2% between Na h-Eileanan Siar and South Ayshire in subset 2 (table \ref{tab:res2-model2-APE}) is comparable to the difference in probability between the second-highest multimorbidity group (6-8 repeat medicines) and it's reference group (0-2 repeat medicines). However, it must be noted this was the largest inter-council difference in subset 2 (the corresponding difference in subset 1 was 5%) and many APEs for councils were broadly similar. Given the variation in linkage rates across local authority areas, and the lack of multi-level modelling in analysis, robust conclusions about the effect of local authority of residence and receipt of social care cannot be drawn at present. Nevertheless, this is an important finding that warrants further exploration. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that social care receipt is driven primarily by age and multimorbidity stauts. These factors attenuate a large proportion of the greater rates of care delivered to females and those living in more deprived areas. The findings support the "intensification" description of social care provision and add evidence that care is concentrated on those with high levels of multimorbidity living in the poorest areas. Increasing prevelence of multimorbidity and the increasing proportion of the population in older age groups are likely to increase demand for social care services significantly.    

\subsection{Patterns in unplanned hospital admissions}

Descriptive statistics (section \ref{sec:res1-adm}) and models (section \ref{sec:res3-usc}) analysing factors associated with unplanned hospital admission in the six months after the end of each financial year reveal a relationship between multimorbidity and admission. Average Partial Effects increase with severity of multimorbidity, a pattern easily discernable from the change in colour by multimorbidity group in figure \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-3} and the more naive visualisation in figure \ref{fig:results1-adm-demos}. The magnitude of multimorbidity APEs, as for all variables, are much lower than seen in social care models. For example, compared with being in the lowest multimorbidity group, being in the highest multimorbidity group (9 plus repeat medicines) increases the probability of unplanned admission by between 8% and 9% across models.

The increase in probability of admission of 6%-7% and 7%-8% for those that received social care or had previously used any form of unscheduled care (unplanned admission, A & E, GP OOH, NHS24 or Ambulance service) respectively, indicates those with hospital admissions are more likely to be high users of all health and social care services - although there is one interesting exception. The direction of effect on unplanned hospital admission for those living in a care home changes from 2014/15 onwards. In models fitted to earlier financial years, living in a care home has a small (<1%) increase in probablity of unplanned admission. Models fitted to data from 2014/15 and 2015/16 show a decreased probability of admission of almost 2%. It is difficult to ascertain the cause of this change although the obvious temporal difference does raise concerns about data collection methods.     

An increase in APEs is also seen through age groups with a noticeable larger gap in APEs between the 75-79 and 80-84 age groups and the 80-84 and 85-89 age groups. Age group 90-94 has an overall higher magnitude of APE than the 95 plus age group although larger confidence intervals, which overlap in all years, are present suggesting there is little difference in APE over the age of 90.  

The models fitted to identify factors associated with unplanned hospital admissions had a poor fit as measured by McFadden's pseudo $R^{2}$ in all years and, therefore, caution is required when interpreting results. There is the possibility that other unmeasured factors could improve model fit. It also notable that the magnitude of APEs are considerably smaller than seen for social care models suggesting more complex factors associated with unplanned hospital admission may exist.  

\subsection{Health and social care integration}

The analyses also adds to evidence that social care provision is focussed on individuals with highest needs, described as "intensification" in chapter \ref{ch:lit-rv}, and visualised most clearly in figures \textbf{NEW FIGURE} and \textbf{NEW FIGURE}. When compared etc etc 

No mm = no social care (Or admissions) adds to debate on preventative and cohesive services in other mm literature.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item MM effect on SC raises important message for policymakers. 
\item Link to "intensification" of SC in lit review. Numbers now so small, can't assess if protective effect for those with less need.
\item Strong argument for universal PC is that it improves access and therefore chance to prevent ill health etc [@RN599, 7]. (although ICL still present)
\item Social care is not universal therefore has poorer access therefore any hope of preventative care is unlikely
\item *If* care was broadend - would need an accurate measure of *need* How should this be defined? How should care be allocted due to it?
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Renfrewshire}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Brief overview of discussion from chapter
\item Also discuss implicit finding that finite number of places for social care in Renfrew. Allocation according to \emph{resource} not \emph{need}. 
\item heatmaps show distribution of users of social care and admission are different. Important if social care is seen as preventer of admission.
\item Medicines decent measure of MM. Clear effects on SC and admissions
\item SIMD effect of MM reduces with age
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Social Care data}\label{sec:disc-sc-data}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Discuss quality and collection of SCS (place this nationally/internationally). Is there good sc data anywhere???
\item What is good/bad - What have I learned?
\item Consider quantifying home care \emph{plus} alarm/telecare users
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Linked Administrative Data Research}\label{sec:disc-admin-data}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Discuss process of obtaining and analysing linked data. Potentially useful for sg and others
\item Timeframe!! Probabaly not a good idea to try this for a PhD given timelines - although has directly led to post-doc research
\item Safe Haven. SDC and software upgrades
\item Suprevisors need to get used to appraising work *in* safe haven. 600 + outputs SDC. Also means format of how to appraise needs agreed. html??
\item Good things???
\item Point to move to re-use data rather than obtain-and-destroy approach
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparisons to previous research}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Bardsley and SR of H \& SC studies (inc care home and jenni's stuff)
\item Kent economic paper
\item MM stuff
\item medicine counts as MM - Brilleman and Salisbury
\item Narrowing of gap in medicines as age increases mirrors Barnett figure 2
\item Prescription counts similar to Guthrie and McCowan
\end{itemize}

\section{Strengths and Limitations}

\subsection{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Large, population sized linkage
\item Marginal effects
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Census week for home care. Compare 2013/14 and later years in table 5.1. ?6o per cent of all social care. Plus loss to linkage - missing half of all individuals?
\item 91\% overall match rate = 9\% misclassification
\item Linkage of SCS not consistent - difficult to make broad comparisons. Attempted to offset by subsetting. Home care stable though falling in SCS - why?
\item Not really assessed Access to social care (mention time constraint?)
\item No measure for living alone
\item MM measure not validated - limited due to lack of access to PC data, Also means cannot address important MM questions as laid by AMS e.g. "Which clusters result in the greatest healthcare utilisation and greatest cost?"
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommended future actions and research}

\subsection{Future research}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Measure \emph{Longitudinal} changes in social care and impact on admission/usc
\item Break down SC data - home care/telecare influence on outcomes
\item consider futher linkage - look for better measure of living arrangements (alone - census?)
\item include USC as independent variable in SC outcome given SC influence on SC
\item Utilise USC data better - include A \& E, NHS24 etc etc
\item Check post-doc list
\item Mortality
\item Further investigate medicines as measure of MM - try chapter counts [@RN228] or continuous rather than categorical OR USE DISEASE DATA FROM USC
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A good title}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Broaden timeframe of SCS collection
\item Support LAs to provide either CHI or easily provide all ID data for linkage
\item Better access to Primary Care data for MM research
\end{itemize}
