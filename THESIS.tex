\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}

Integration of health and social care became law in Scotland on 1st
April 2016. Reflects patterns across the developing world to restructure
health services to cope with demands of an ageing population.

Social Care of increasing policy (and political) importance. Link to
healthcare (and demands on health services) becoming increasingly
apparent (increase delayed discharge etc).

This, in part, due to long-term conditions now major burden of global
disease (replacing infectious diseases). Large proportions of population
have multimorbidity (OECD) which has a number of negative outcomes
including mortality and health care use.

Association of multimorbidity and social care use is unknown.

PhD funding from Scottish Government to assess these topics. (2020
vision and other policy link)

Important part of the funding to link administrative data sources in
order to identify the benefit of this process. \emph{Measurement of
social (or LTC) is improtant for a number of reseons - OECD(2013) page
18, Care co-ordination (integration) is not measured well pp 76,
administrative databases potential to help these problems plus ideas for
outcome measures pp 76 \& 79, pp81 obstacles to data collection
(overcome by data linkage in Soctland??}

(Need WHO policy outlines and other suitable high-level policy docs in
this section)

\section{Aims and Objectives}\label{sec:intro-aims-and-obs}

The thesis has both substantive and methodological aims. Substantively,
it aims to contribute to the debate surrounding health and social care
integration by looking specifically at a group that are likely to be
regular users of both health and social care services, i.e.~those with
multimorbidity. Methodologically, the thesis aims to contribute to
efforts to improve the exploitation of administrative data as a means to
analyse public service performance and effectiveness.

Aims of the project are:-

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Describe and compare social inequalities in the use of social care services using linked health and social care data.
\item Explore the effects of social care use for those with multimorbidity on 
\begin{enumerate} 
\item unscheduled health care use and
\item mortality. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The objectives of the project are:-

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item To assess how access to social care services varies for people with multimorbidity, especially by socioeconomic status.  
\item To assess the impacts of social care service use on health service use and health outcomes for people with multimorbidity, where possible exploiting geographic differences in social care as "natural experiments".
\item To make recommendations for policy on the future of integration of health and social care services based on these results.
\item To assess tho what extant measures of multimorbidity and of health and social care service use can be operationalised using existing linked health and social care administrative data.
\item To make recommendations to policy makers on administrative data collections. 
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Literature Review}\label{ch:lit-review}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:lit-review-intro}

\textbf{Introductory paragraph with link from Thesis introduction - also
may require explanation of lack of structured lit search}

Many countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), have recently seen
policies implemented that aim to integrate the provision of health and
social care services \citep{RN234, RN362, RN262}. In addition to
reducing variations in the provision of care across geographic areas,
these policies hope to save public money by reducing unplanned
admissions and delayed discharges from hospital whilst also improving
the quality of services for individuals \citep{RN232, RN266, RN406}. The
World Health Organisation \citeyearpar{RN320} cites relative
inequalities in improvements of health and life expectancy, within and
between countries, as justification for recommended structural change to
healthcare. The main recommendation is for governmental policy to shift
healthcare focus from acute hospital care to outpatient and community
care \citep{RN320}. The paradigm shift in the method of service delivery
is suggested in response to increasing long-term, chronic conditions
forming the major burden of care worldwide. Acute secondary care is
expensive, thus the shift in care also reflects the need to find
affordable models of healthcare in an age of diminishing budgets
worldwide \citep{RN320}. Integrating health and social care services and
increasing primary care spend are cited as two potential ways of
facilitating this shift in focus \citep{RN320}. Policies introduced that
facilitate integration of services have been implemented despite little
evidence to suggest they will have the desired effect
\citep{RN367, RN369, RN234, RN233, RN321, RN362, RN366, RN260}. The
continued drive to integrate services does, however, implicitly
acknowledge that health and social care services are linked. How these
services interact at the individual level and whether differing levels
of provision in each service affects the other is not well understood
\citep{RN361, RN205, RN406}.

Internationally, provision of social care has become one of the most
important issues for policy makers in recent years \citep{RN406, RN250}.
In Scotland, approximately two-thirds of individuals receiving social
care services are over the age of 65 \citep{RN128} whilst approximately
two-thirds of all those over the age of 65 have multimorbidity (two or
more health conditions) \citep{RN33}. It would seem intuitive that a
large proportion of those receiving social care (if not all) have
multimorbidity. However, no single data source exists that allows this
comparison to be made. Nevertheless, guidelines exist for healthcare
professionals to assist in assessing the social care needs of older
people with multiple long term conditions \citep{RN150}. Multimorbidity
is associated with a number of negative outcomes including increased
health care usage \citep{RN226}. Whether multimorbidity increases use of
social care services is unknown but this could have an important role in
informing policy decisions regarding social care provision.

Levels of multimorbidity in the Scottish population follow a stark
socioeconomic profile with those of lower socioeconomic position having
higher levels of multiple conditions and more complex care needs
\citep{RN33, RN21}. This inequality in outcome is compounded by the fact
that primary care provision in areas of higher socioeconomic
disadvantage, and thus areas of higher need, receive the same or less
funding as other more affluent areas. This inequity in provision of
service demonstrates existence of the inverse care law in primary care
services \citep{RN120, RN39, RN148} which states, ``The availability of
good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the
population served \citep{RN120}.'' Little is known about how access to
social care differs across socioeconomic and geographic strata. Health
services are free to access at the point of need whereas social care is
provided by Local Authorities and access is regulated by eligibility
criteria. In an age of austerity, the question of whether an inverse
\emph{social} care law exists remains unanswered.

Until recently many local authorities had attempted to protect
front-line services, such as social care, from austerity cuts
\citep{RN117}. However, given continued year-on-year reductions and a
further 7.2\% cut to local authority spending in 2016/2017
\citep{RN251}, the ability to protect social care from reductions in
spend becomes less likely. Decreased local government budgets across the
UK and Scotland since 2010 have affected those living in the poorest
areas hardest \citep{RN117, RN235}. If social care budgets decrease
further, the question of whether the most deprived areas will feel these
cuts most is of grave importance.

The overall aim of the PhD project is to empirically explore these
issues. This chapter will specifically review literature regarding the
three main themes outlined above namely; social care, the interaction of
health and social care services, and multimorbidity. Section
\ref{sec:access-sc} reviews definitions, international models, and
variation in access to social care. Section \ref{sec:hsc-interaction}
outlines the policy framework regarding health and social care services,
how these services are funded and delivered, and why they are linked. It
then describes the legislation that made health and social care
integration law in Scotland before reviewing empirical evidence of the
nature of the interaction between health and social care services.
Finally, Section \ref{sec:mm} describes why multimorbidity is important
in the context of health and social care integration and then provides
an overview of academic literature and policy documents regarding
multimorbidity and its definitions, measurement, and epidemiology.

\section{Access to Social Care}\label{sec:access-sc}

\subsection{Definitions}\label{subsec:access-sc-defs}

As in the case of multimorbidity, discussed in section
\ref{subsec:mm-defs}, there is no internationally (or nationally)
accepted definition of social care. Indeed, the difference between what
is social care and what is health care has no clear line of demarcation
resulting in local variation in provision of services \citep{RN371}. The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the
European Union (EU) jointly published a report on Long Term Care (LTC)
for older people discussing much of what may be described in the UK as
social care. In the report, LTC is defined as,

\begin{quotation}
"... a range of services required by persons with a reduced degree of functional capacity, physical or cognitive, and who are consequently dependent for an extended period of time on help with basic activities of daily living (ADL). This "personal care" component is frequently provided in combination with help with basic medical services such as "nursing care" (wound dressing, pain management, medication, health monitoring), as well as prevention, rehabilitation or palliative care. Long-term care services can also be combined with lower level care related to “domestic help” or help with instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)." 
\end{quotation}

\citep[pp38]{RN406}

A recent NICE guideline \citeyearpar{RN150} addressing social care needs
for older people with multiple chronic conditions, used a definition
provided in the UK Health and Social Care Act \citeyearpar{RN149}:-

\begin{quotation}
    ““Adult social care”—
    (a) includes all forms of personal care and other practical assistance provided for individuals who, by reason of age, illness, disability, pregnancy, childbirth, dependence on alcohol or drugs, or any other similar circumstances, are in need of such care or other assistance, but 
    (b) does not include anything provided by an establishment or agency for which Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills is the registration authority under section 5 of the Care Standards Act 2000.”
    (The Health and Social Care Act  2012 c7, Part 3, Chapter 1, Section 65, Subsection 4)
\end{quotation}

The NICE guideline \citeyearpar{RN150} advises that social care planning
for people with multimorbidity should include holistic assessment of
biopsychosocial factors including sexual, spiritual, cultural, and
communication needs as well as considering access to leisure and social
activities incorporating issues regarding mobility and transport.
Specifically, the guideline cites; self-care, taking medicines,
learning, volunteering, maintaining a home, financial management,
employment, socialising with friends and hobbies as activities that all
patients should be able to take part in should they wish and social care
assessment should assess the ability of the individual to achieve this.

A more succinct definition of social care is used in a report to the
Minister for Care Services at the UK Department of Health, :-

\begin{quotation}
    "The group of services that provide personal care and support to people in social situations – such as family; the community; a communal setting; to help them achieve independence and to promote their positive contribution as citizens." Platt 
\end{quotation}

\citeyearpar[pp.~4]{RN154}

Huxley et al. \citeyearpar{RN153} are critical of this service-based
definition and argue that social care is intended to improve general
well-being for those that are in need. As quality of life is an
important factor of well-being, Huxley et al. \citeyearpar{RN153} argue
that wider issues regarding environment and the quality of public and
private services also play an important role in social care. Indeed,
Daly and Lewis \citeyearpar[pp.287]{RN146} argue that social care is
``\ldots{}an activity and set of relations lying at the intersection of
state, market, family (and voluntary sector) relations.''

This view is reflected in an aspirational constitution for social care
published by an independent, cross-party think-tank \citep{RN136}. The
authors argue that all citizens should have an equal ability to live and
control a full and active life. Where this is not possible the state
should have a duty to provide the necessary help, in whatever form that
is required, to individuals who require it.

A more clearly defined concept is that of \emph{personal care} which has
been provided for free in Scotland since 2002. The legislation
introduced by the then Scottish Executive necessitated a clear
definition and constitutes six dimensions \citep[pp.256]{RN373}.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Personal Hygiene: washing etc.  
\item Personal Assistance: help with dressings, prostheses etc.  
\item Continence Management: toileting, catheter management etc.  
\item Food and Diet: help with eating, food preparation etc.  
\item Problems of Immobility:  
\item Simple Treatments: help with medicines, creams, oxygen therapy etc. 
\end{itemize}

Personal care is, however, only one aspect of social care provision and
clear definitions of other services provided to individuals are lacking.
Nevertheless, the definitions of social (or long-term) care above all
highlight services that are required to aid with an individual's
functional or cognitive needs.

\subsection{International models of social care}\label{subsec:access-sc-models}

There are four ways in which social care
\footnote{International, and particularly European, literature more frequently uses the phrase "long term care" to describe the kinds of services outlined in section \ref{subsec:access-sc-defs}. The term "social care" is used in-lieu for the purposes of this thesis.}
can be provided to those in need: informally via family or community,
formally via voluntary non-profit organisations, formally via the state,
or formally via a for-profit organisations \citep{RN346}. In Europe,
increasing demand from users has led to many welfare systems being
unable to adequately provide care \citep{RN344, RN414}. Changes in
demography, the labour market, democracy, and values have all
contributed to the increasing pressure on care services
\citep{RN406, RN342, RN414}. There is wide consensus that lower birth
rates and higher proportions of older people mean that a gap has emerged
in the number of adult children able to provide informal care to their
parents \citep{RN342, RN343, RN344, RN346, RN345, RN414}. Traditionally,
informal care was provided by women. As gender equality improves, more
women are employed outwith domestic circumstances which also reduces the
pool of informal social care available \citep{RN342}. Anttonen
\citeyearpar{RN342} also cites changes in societal attitudes from
``familism'' to ``individualism'' as having an impact on informal care
resources. These combined factors mean that formal care services are
increasingly required to provide social care. Pressures on these
services has seen increased discussion and comparison of models of care
across Europe over the last 20 years \citep{RN347, RN348, RN346, RN349}.

In a report for the OECD, Colombo et al \citeyearpar{RN414} categorised
the varying models of social care into three main groups with
subdivisions as shown in Table \ref{tab:oecd-soc-care}.

          \begin{tablenotes}

      \end{tablenotes}
  \end{threeparttable}
  }
\end{table}

Universal models of social care are characterised by; a) a single system
being in place for delivery of services, b) nursing \emph{and} personal
care are provided for all individuals meeting defined eligibility
criteria, and c) some form of charge is levied on service-users
\citep{RN414}. Three subdivisions of universal coverage social care
models are identified in this classification.

The tax-based universal models, also known as the Nordic model of care,
have strong local-government influence in both the raising of funds and
delivery of services \citep{RN414, RN348, RN346, RN349}. Overall
responsibility remains with national government which also contributes
funds, often dependent on local population need and structure
\citep{RN414}. Public long-term insurance schemes are mandatory in the
countries that employ them, although the age at which citizens begin to
contribute varies (e.g.~only over 40s contribute in Japan)
\citep{RN414, RN413, RN407}. These models have found it increasingly
difficult to fund provision and have either increased user-payments or
decreased coverage in recent years \citep{RN345, RN413, RN407}. In
Belgium, social care is viewed as a health risk and is financed through
the health system with a cap on user-contribution. This results in a
medical (rather than social) model of care delivery, mostly provided by
nurses \citep{RN414}.

In contrast to universal models described above where a single system is
in place for social care delivery, mixed social care systems employ
either; a) universal coverage via different sources/sectors or b) a
mixture of universal and means-tested benefits \citep{RN414}. Whilst
acknowledging the wide variation in systems, Colombo et al
\citeyearpar{RN414} identify three subdivisions of mixed system models
of social care as shown in table \ref{tab:oecd-soc-care}.

Parallel universal schemes provide social care via two or more sectors
(e.g.~nursing care via health provider and personal care from a
non-healthcare source) \citep{RN414}. Major differences exist between
countries in how this is delivered in practice with varying degrees of
coverage. Income related universal benefits provide needs-based
universal coverage of social care but benefits received vary according
to income \citep{RN414}. France provides an good example of this system
where cash benefits are needs \emph{and} income based - benefits are
paid at six levels of dependency, those with higher incomes are paid
proportionally less and top-up care costs themselves
\citep{RN414, RN420}. The final subdivision of mixed social care models
has some universal entitlements provided alongside means-tested services
e.g.~free provision of nursing care with means-testing for personal
care.

Colombo et al \citeyearpar{RN414} include Spain and Greece in this final
subdivision of mixed social care models but note these countries have
formal care systems that are much less developed than elsewhere in the
OECD. Sometimes referred to as the Mediterranean model, informal care
from family and other sources constitutes the main form of social care
in these countries \citep{RN348, RN346, RN349}. As this role is
traditionally carried out by women, the Mediterranean model has
attracted criticism from a feminist perspective \citep{RN346}.

The final model in Colombo et al's \citeyearpar{RN414} classification of
social care in OECD countries is the Means-tested safety net model
(Table \ref{tab:oecd-soc-care}). In this model only those below a
pre-determined threshold are entitles to state-provided social care.
Despite the free provision of health care and some non-means-tested
benefits, England is included in this category in the report. Presumably
this is due to the fact that state support in a residential home in
England is provided only after an individual has depleted both income
\emph{and} assets below a threshold \citep{RN414}, a system not seen in
other countries
\footnote{A cap of approximately £72,000 total contribution was to be introduced in 2016 (Eleftheriades et al., 2013)}
\citep{RN420}.

Of the three models of social care described in this section, universal
systems have a number of advantages over the other two
\citep{RN414, RN420}. Sharing the burden of social care provision among
the entire population, either via general taxation or mandatory
insurance schemes, results in a reliable, predictable source of finance
enabling states to plan more effectively \citep{RN414, RN420, RN413}.
Mixed systems of social care can still result in considerable costs for
those that require care, whereas the costs to individuals in the
means-tested system can be ``catastrophic'' \citep[pp240]{RN414}. The
means-tested system can also be perceived as unfair for those that need
to sell assets (such as a house) to pay for care, particularly when
there is variation in eligibility criteria within countries
\citep{RN414, RN420, RN421, RN407, RN413}. A particular advantage of a
universal social care systems is that it,

\begin{quotation} 
"...generally reduces utilisation of more expensive health care services and professionals (e.g. hospital care, doctors) for long-term care needs, for example by making "social hospitilisation" of frail people with [social care] needs more difficult." 
\end{quotation}

\citep[pp.222]{RN414}

Given the pressures on state budgets and the desire to adequately fund
care services, this seems a particularly useful benefit of the universal
coverage model of social care.

Disadvantages of universal systems are that they, generally, are more
expensive to the state than other models of social care and can reduce
the amount of informal care provided by relatives for elderly family
\citep{RN414, RN407}. The comprehensiveness of coverage can be
over-burdensome for the state with a number of countries recently having
to cut service or increase user-contributions to compensate for
increasing demand \citep{RN345, RN421, RN407, RN413}.

A recent examination of the effects of the 2008 financial crisis on the
way social care is delivered across Europe suggests that the
distinctions between social care models is beginning to blur
\citep{RN343}. There is evidence those with more comprehensive coverage
are reducing levels of care whilst those with less coverage are
increasing provision \citep{RN414}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \caption{Older recipients of long-term care services as a share of the over 65 population, 2008}
  \label{fig:oecd-comparison}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/oecd-comparison.PNG}
\end{figure}

Given the marked variations in how social care is funded and delivered
across countries, it may be expected that there are also marked
varations in levels of access and utilisation. Colombo et al
\citeyearpar{RN414} produced a chart (shown in figure
\ref{fig:oecd-comparison}) derived from OECD data that shows the
proportion of over 65s receiving some form of social care across
countries for which data is provided. The chart shows that having a
universal or mixed system of social care provision (as described above)
does not absolutely influence the number of people receiving care. For
example, South Korea employs a universal (insurance-based) system and
has one of the lowest proportions of older people receiving care,
whereas Swizerland has one of the highest whilst employing a mixed
system involving some universal and some means-tested benefits. This
suggests that eligibility criteria set within countries are likely to be
more important in determining access to social care than any particular
system of care delivery.

Social care can be seen as\\
a) a group of services such as; skilled nursing care, social work,
personal care, medical equipement \& technologies, and therapies.
Delivered by,\\
b) delivered by a range of professionals such as; nurses, low-skilled
carers, or allied health professionals. In,\\
c) various locations such as; at home, in an institution, or via
community care.

Policy choices across how each of these domains are funded and delivered
result in the marked varations across contries in how social care is
accessed and delivered \citep{RN414}.

\subsection{Access to Social Care I - Eligibility}\label{subsec:access-sc-eligibility}

\subsubsection{Social Theory of eligibility}\label{subsubsec:eligibility-theory}

This section will variation in access to social care \emph{within} Local
Authorities. Theory regarding ``Street level Bureaucracy'' and
``Candidacy'' will be described.

A useful defintition of assessment and eligibility is provided by
Eleftheriades \& Wittenberg \citeyearpar[pp.2]{RN407},

\begin{quotation}
"...the \emph{criteria} under which a given individual is eligible for publicly funded support for long-term care, and for how much support the individual is eligible, and the \emph{processes} involved in selecting from the general population those who receive this support and determining for how much support each person is eligible"
\end{quotation}

Two social theories on how eligibility for public services are
determined will be discussed in this subsection; Street-level
bureaucracy and candidacy.

The term Street-level bureaucracy is generally credited to Michael
Lipsky and his book of the same name \citeyearpar{RN174}, along with its
more recent revision \citep{RN430}. The theory investigates the extent
to which front-line public service workers exercise discretion in which
individuals of the general public are eligible to access any given
service - doing so from a position of authority \citep{RN430}. As a
result, Street-level bureaucrats control, ``\ldots{}the nature, amount,
and quality of benefits and sanctions provided by their agencies.''
\citep[pp.13]{RN430}. \citep{RN428}

\subsubsection{Eligibility for social care in the UK}\label{subsubsec:eligibility-uk}

Literature and evidence of how eligibility affects access will also be
presented.

Access to social care in Scotland is means tested via assessment carried
out by a social worker. The criteria for social care delivery,
therefore, has a very important part to play in how services are
accessed. This section describes relevant literature on how eligibility
criteria are set.

In 2010 the Scottish Government published a report identifying a
strategy for the policy of self-directed support \citep{RN171}. The
report was written in conjunction with the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities~(COSLA) and included the recommendation that the National
Eligibility Framework developed by the Sutherland review into free
personal and nursing care \citeyearpar{RN172} should be applied across
all social care services. The framework has four criteria for assessing
risk in relation to a person's care needs: Critical, Substantial,
Moderate and Low \citep{RN184}. The Critical and Substantial levels of
risk indicate social care needs should be addressed immediately or
imminently, whereas a moderate level of risk may indicate either some or
no services being required. There is no explicit description of severity
or which care needs fall into each category and in practice each Local
Authority sets the criteria and decided at which level of risk they
would provide social care \citep{RN170}.

Equity of access to services is directly influenced by an eligibility
framework. Indeed, the Strategy for Self-Directed Support
\citep[pp.20]{RN171} acknowledges this and states that such a framework
``\ldots{}can result in resources being narrowly focused on individuals
with acute needs.'' However, the report goes on to state that growing
demand and finite resources requires some form of eligibility assessment
but this should not have a disproportionate effect on any one group of
people requiring care.

The eligibility framework allows each Local Authority to set thresholds
for access to care in line with local priorities and resources. This has
the effect that access to services varies across differing council
areas. The potential for regional variation is again acknowledged by the
Strategy for Self-Directed Support \citep[pp.20]{RN171} which states
that, ``\ldots{}further work will be undertaken by the Scottish
Government and COSLA to assess whether there is merit in establishing
national thresholds for access to formal support across all client
groups.''

Acknowledgment of problems with eligibility criteria and the promise of
``further work'' to be undertaken by the Scottish Government and COSLA
is repeated in practitioner guidance on Self-Directed Support published
in 2014 \citep[pp.19]{RN170} and that , ``\ldots{}it remains the case
that local authorities should operate eligibility criteria to determine
whether or not an individual assessed as having social care needs can
access formal support and if so, which of their needs are to be met by
that support.''

Data is not available on levels of care provided by LAs for each of the
National Eligibility Framework criteria or for the threshold that each
LA provides care at. The Scottish Government collects an annual report
of eligibility and waiting times for the 1st quarter of the year. The
latest report \citep{RN184} provides information on the time individuals
had to wait to receive assessment and the time individuals had to wait
to receive care in the period January-March for the preceding 5 years.
However, no absolute numbers of people in each category is provided.

The Scottish National Eligibility Framework has striking similarities to
that formerly used in England and described in Fair Access to Care
Services (FACS) produced by the Social Care Institute for Excellence
(SCIE) \citeyearpar{RN138}. Exactly the same nomenclature is used to
describe the eligibility categories of need. Newton and Browne
\citeyearpar{RN163} critiqued a previous version the FACS guidance and
found similar issues to those raised above regarding regional variations
in service and concentration of services on those with the highest need.
Their paper describes further issues with access to social care in the
context of social theory described by Lipsky \citeyearpar{RN174} and
``Street level bureaucracy'' where intentional and unintentional
judgment of entitlement by social care workers have an impact on whether
an individual receives care or not. Newton and Browne
\citeyearpar{RN163} also make the assertion that health and social care
has never been accessed equitably by arguing that those with a greater
ability to articulate needs and negotiate access are more likely to gain
access to services. Although no citation is provided to back-up this
argument it has certainly been described elsewhere \citep{RN118} and
sits well in the broader discussion of inequitable access to services
\citep{RN116, RN175, RN120}.

In England, the Care Act \citeyearpar{RN176} aimed to remove regional
variations in eligibility in access to social care by imposing national
minimum thresholds that Local Authorities would have a statutory
obligation to provide. The Care Act also aimed to ensure Local
Authorities provided care, ``\ldots{}as early as possible to help
maintain well-being and independence, and potentially delay a situation
where longer-term care and support might be required.''
\citep[pp.2]{RN169}. The minimum criteria for being eligible for care
involves an individual having needs that impairs their ability to meet 2
or more of a designated list of outcomes (e.g.~managing and maintaining
nutrition or maintaining hygiene) \citep{RN169} and is set by the
Secretary of State for Health \citep{RN177}.

In practice, the most likely outcome is that the minimum threshold that
Local Authorities will have to provide care will be similar to the
``Critical'' level of the National Eligibility Framework previously used
in the FACS guidance \citep{RN173, RN177} (and similar to that used in
Scotland). This will legalise a shift that has already been occurring in
England where fewer numbers of LAs are providing care for those with
``moderate'' needs and only providing care for those with ``critical''
needs \citep{RN173, RN177}. Burchardt et al. \citeyearpar{RN173} state
that only 2\% of English LAs will have to widen their care threshold
whereas 12\% could now, legally, tighten care provision as a result of
the Care Act. This situation is not new and has been gradually worsening
over the past decade and has profound impacts on the quality of, and
access to, social care. Indeed:-

\begin{quotation}
"It is through the eligibility criteria that resources are rationed, that is "need" is equated with "resources available". This mechanism severely limited the idea that provision could be determined either by need or by the right to services."
\end{quotation}

\citep[pp.10]{RN374}

A recent report by the House of Commons Communities and Local Government
Committee \citeyearpar{RN287} confirmed reductions in the absolute
number of people receiving care, the concentration of services in those
with highest needs only, reduction in quality of care provided, and the
resulting pressures this caused to the health service through increased
emergency admissions and delayed discharges. The report highlights the
perilous state of social care provision in England and urges immediate
attention from the government to address funding shortfalls.

Burchardt et al. \citeyearpar{RN173} and Abrahams et al.
\citeyearpar{RN177} recognise some positive changes to Social Care
policy through the Social Care Act but are damning about past UK
Government Social Care policy in England and Wales. They cite chronic
underfunding and cuts for over ten years resulting in fewer numbers of
people receiving care at a time when demand is sharply increasing due to
demographic change. The ``intensification'' of services on those with
the most acute needs is cited by both sets of authors as
counterproductive -- ignoring those with moderate care needs completely
derails one of the main purposes of the Care Act, preventative services.
Indeed,

\begin{quotation}
    “As well as lacking in moral sense, such an approach is economically unsound. Waiting for people to have high needs before providing care means that care will be more expensive, as well as pushing more older people into an already pressurised NHS. ” \end{quotation}

\citep[pp.5]{RN177}

A similar picture has been seen in Scotland. Absolute numbers of people
receiving home care has steadily fallen over the last 10 years whilst
the number of hours of care provided has increased \citep{RN128}. There
are wide variations in the number of hours of home care provided per
population across Local Authorities \citep{RN128}. This may reflect
different demographic make-up of each Local Authority although
reductions in ratios per population can be seen in almost all Local
Authorities {[}\emph{edit - I can produce a table here to reflect this
but is that appropriate in the Intro? Also would have to provide code in
the Appendix to show how I produced the table}{]}.

In a report profiling the care at home sector in Scotland. MacLeod and
Mair \citeyearpar{RN147} describe large decreases in absolute numbers of
people receiving care at home over the ten years to 2013. There have
also been significant reductions in the number of people receiving
non-personal care (so called ``mopping and shopping''). The increase in
the number of hours of home care delivered by all services reflects a
focus on smaller numbers of individuals with higher care needs. This
means those with moderate or low personal care needs and those requiring
``mopping and shopping'' services are now less likely to receive
publicly funded care. Echoing the views of Burchardt et al.
\citeyearpar{RN173} and Abrahams et al. \citeyearpar{RN177}, Macleod and
Mair \citeyearpar{RN147} highlight the potential false economy of this
situation -- home care services are likely to reduce the need for costly
emergency admissions to hospital and delay the requirement for more
intensive home care packages.

\subsection{Access to Social Care II - Resource allocation}\label{subsec:access-resources}

\subsubsection{Social Theory of Resource Allocation}\label{subsubsec:theory-resources}

\subsubsection{Resource Allocation for Social Care in the UK}\label{subsubsec:resources-uk}

This section will discuss social science theory of fair allocation of
resources to Local Authorities such as ``the strategy of equality.''
Will need to outline how social care is funded in the UK Here, the
``inverse care law'' will also be discussed.

Evidence and literature of how funding is distributed will also be
presented.

\subsection{Health inequalities}\label{subsec:health-inequals}

This section will outline why access to services are linked to health
inequalities (with reference to section \ref{subsec:access-resources}).
Then summarise main literature on health inequalities (briefly).

In the UK, poverty remains the largest predictor of relative ill health
and has associations with increased morbidity, multimorbidity, and
decreased life expectancy \citep{RN37}. People living in deprived areas
are more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, experience
multimorbidity at a younger age, and live in overcrowded or unsuitable
housing \citep{RN37, RN311}. The influential Marmot review into health
inequalities found that those in the most deprived areas of England die,
on average, 7 years earlier than their most affluent peers \citep{RN312}
with the gap in life expectancy increasing between 1995 and 2008
\citep{RN313}. Subsequent research by the King's Fund suggests the gap
in life expectancy reduced between the periods 1999-2003 and 2006-2010
\citep{RN314}. The report warns that this improvement may be due to the
spending and policy decisions of the New Labour Government of the early
2000s and that recent austerity measures in the UK may undermine the
progress made \citep{RN314}. Indeed, the most recent analysis released
by the Office for National Statistics \citeyearpar{RN375} suggests the
gap in male life expectancy in England is now 9.1 years. In Northern
Ireland, the male life expectancy gap is the lowest of all 4 UK nations,
however those in the poorest neighbourhoods die, on average, 4 years
earlier than those in the most affluent areas \citep{RN375}. In Wales
the gap is slightly larger at 4.2 years \citep{RN375}. There is a gap of
7 years in life expectancy at birth in Scottish males - those born in
East Dunbartonshire can expect to live to 80.5 years, whereas those in
Glasgow city can expect to live 73.4 years \citep{RN375}. In Scotland,
the Government reports statistics on healthy life expectancy which is
defined as the number of years people can expect to live in good health
\citep{RN315}. The most recent figures suggest men and women in the most
deprived areas can expect to become ill 25.1 and 22.1 years earlier than
their most affluent peers respectively \citep{RN315} meaning Scotland
has the highest levels of health inequalities in western and central
Europe \citep{RN385, RN386}.

These disparities in life expectancy are compounded by inequities in
access to health services. The inverse care law - the availability of
good medical care varying inversely with the need for it in the
population served \citep{RN120} - persists. As discussed above, the most
deprived areas have lower life expectancy and higher morbidity figures
and therefore greater health needs \citep{RN37}. However, the poorest
neighbourhoods in England have been reported to have 62.5 General
Practitioners (GP) per 100,000 population whereas the most affluent
neighbourhoods have 76.2 per 100,000 \citep{RN317} suggesting health
provision does not match need. Recent planned changes in policy to
distribute primary care funding based on population age are likely to
exacerbate this situation \citep{RN39}. Indeed, increases in workload
with deteriorating proportions of budgets has lead the King's Fund to
describe the situation in primary care in England and Wales as, ``in
crisis'' \citep[pp.3]{RN318}. In Scotland, the even distribution of GP
workforce among the population means GP practices in the most deprived
areas need to provide more consultations, for people with greater needs,
at the same funding level as practices with fewer resource demands
\citep{RN148, RN27}. Poorer access to primary health care is associated
with greater demand for unnecessary admission to hospital
\citep{RN49, RN268} which is responsible for high proportions of
healthcare expenditure. Studies with interventions to improve access to
primary care have shown reductions in unnecessary secondary care use
\citep{RN245, RN246, RN272} providing an economic, as well as moral,
case for primary care investment. As acute hospital admission rates
rise, tackling health inequalities is a major policy priority and
primary care can play a pivotal role in this action \citep{RN319}.

There are many theories as to why inequalities in health exist across
social class \citep{RN327, RN333}. Some of these, such as statistical
artefact and biological reasons, were rejected as being implausible by
the Black report \citep{RN277}. To a large extent, epidemiological
evidence and theoretical argument has agreed with that view
\citep{RN327, RN83, RN82, RN333}. There have been many critiques of the
theories proposed in the last 35 years which focus on differing numbers
proposals \citep{RN327, RN333, RN377, RN378, RN83}. Whilst arguments
over which theory is most plausible to explain the cause of health
inequality, most researchers agree on ways to remedy disparities in
health outcome namely the redistribution of income, wealth and political
power \citep{RN378, RN391, RN327, RN333}. Although health services have
an important role to play, it is the ``upstream'' policies of
redistribution that will make the biggest impacts in improving health
outcomes across society \citep{RN378, RN391, RN327, RN325}. Whilst this
has been known for some time, government policies in the UK to date have
not addressed these issues and have thus failed to make meaningful
improvements in health inequalities \citep{RN330, RN331, RN377}.

\subsection{Summary}\label{subsec:access-sc-summary}

A summary of the literature presented in section \ref{sec:access-sc}

Varying definitions of social care. Differing European models described
in literature - all now showing signs of change due to impact of ageing
population. (Findings of differing access across these models section).
Two main social theories with regard to access to services. One about
allocation of resources, other about distribution of resources by
providers.

Social care is an increasing policy priority across Europe due to
demographic trends and reductions in the amount of state-based funding
available to provide care. All countries, regardless of model of social
care, have seen increases in market-based systems and increased use of
private care. The boundary between health and social care is not clearly
defined. In the UK this means provision of services is decided locally
which is likely to result in variation in provision and therefore
outcomes. Devolution has resulted in variations in policy across the UK,
most notably in the free provision of personal care in Scotland.
However, there have been marked reductions in the amounts of social care
delivered in both England and Scotland largely due to tightening of
access to services through eligibility criteria. This has led to
warnings that reduction in service provision is likely to be
counter-productive in terms of service experience and cost to
governments.

help inform understanding of concept

\subsection{Definitions}\label{subsec:mm-defs}

Despite the increasing importance of multimorbidity on health care
systems, there is no internationally agreed definition of the term or
concept \citep{RN89, RN95}. Van den Akker et al \citeyearpar{RN19} first
made the distinction between the terms comorbidity and multimorbidity.
Comorbidity was originally described by Fenstein \citep[pp.467]{RN338}
who stated, ``In a patient with a particular index disease, the term
co-morbidity refers to any additional co-existing ailment.'' Van Den
Akker et al. \citeyearpar[pp.65]{RN19} used the term multimorbidity to
describe, ``\ldots{}any co-occurrence of medical conditions within a
person.'' In this sense, multimorbidity does not rely on the presence of
a primary, or index, disease but refers to the overall state of multiple
illnesses.

Further development of definitions is provided by Valderas et al.
\citep{RN64} who characterise the construct of the term comorbidity
found in the literature in four main groups; (a) comorbidity --
additional diseases in the context of an index disease, (b)
multimorbidity -- more than one disease within an individual (without
reference to an index disease), (c) morbidity burden -- total impact of
physiological dysfunction linked to patient outcomes and (d) patient
complexity -- the effect of non-health characteristics
(e.g.~deprivation, culture, environment) on morbidity burden.

Valderas et al. \citep{RN64} discuss these four constructs of
comorbidity further in relation to three main research areas; clinical
care, epidemiology and public health, and health service planning. It is
suggested that comorbidity may be a more valid definition for use in
specialist clinical care, whereas multimorbidity and morbidity burden
would be more appropriate in primary care research. In epidemiological
and public health research, the definitions of either comorbidity or
multimorbidity would be of use depending on the origin of the diseases
being studied and the particular research questions being investigated.
Morbidity burden and patient complexity are, according to Valderas et
al. \citep{RN64}, the most appropriate definitions for research
exploring healthcare use and costs.

A further definition of multimorbidity is offered by the European
General Practice Research Network (EGPRN) who report findings of a
systematic review in the construction of their definition. Citing over
100 different definitions for multimorbidity in academic research the
EGPRN \citep[pp.1]{RN77} aimed to clarify the concept of multimorbidity
and define the term as

\begin{quotation} "...any combination of chronic disease with at least one other disease (acute or chronic) biopsychosocial factor (associated or not) or somatic risk factor." \end{quotation}

This definition goes some way to capture the complexity of the concept
of multimorbidity as explained by Valderas et al. \citeyearpar{RN64} but
has not ended debate on the matter.

More recently, a systematic review focused on which diseases, risk
factors and symptoms are included in varying definitions of
multimorbidity \citep{RN254}. Whilst the majority of included studies in
the review indicated multimorbidity as the presence of two or more
conditions, Willadsen et al \citeyearpar{RN254} found the total number
of diseases, risk factors, and symptoms used varied from 4 to 147. Of
the 167 included articles in the review, 115 different ways of defining
multimorbidity were identified \citep{RN254}.

In a recently published guideline, the National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) \citep{RN226} acknowledge the complexity of
defining multimorbidity. NICE agree with other commentators \citep{RN21}
that basing the definition of multimorbidity on 2 or more health
conditions only does not fully capture a clinically meaningful picture
of the concept. The guideline highlights the fact that many people
defined as multimorbid in this way may not be ill and have excellent
quality of life requiring little or no health care input \citep{RN226}.
For this reason the guideline is aimed at people with more than 1
long-term condition with any of the following:-

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Difficulty managing treatments or day-to-day activities.
\item
  Care from multiple services and requiring care from a new service.
\item
  Both long-term physical and mental health conditions.
\item
  Frailty.
\item
  Frequent use of unplanned or emergency care.
\item
  Prescription of multiple, regular medicines.
\end{itemize}

\citep{RN226}

Although multimorbidity may seem to be an intuitive thing to understand,
defining a useful concept of the term is much more difficult
\citep{RN155}. Whilst the co-occurrence of 2 or more long-term
conditions is the most commonly used definition of multimorbidity, there
are wide variations in the number of conditions from which this
definition can be based. This lack of clarity means that identifying
useful ways to measure Multimorbidity is also problematic with marked
variations in approaches.

\subsection{Measurement}\label{subsec:mm-measures}

The findings of three recent systematic reviews have highlighted the
myriad ways researchers have approached the measurement of
multimorbidity \citep{RN16, RN34, RN29}. Each review aimed to collate
evidence of measurement tools in comorbidity or multimorbidity but from
different perspectives: De Groot et al \citeyearpar{RN16} searched for
comorbidity indices to inform research into Multiple Sclerosis,
Diederichs et al \citeyearpar{RN34} specifically searched for
multimorbidity measurement indices, whereas Huntley et al
\citeyearpar{RN29} searched for measures of multimorbidity used only in
primary care research. The systematic reviews found 13, 39 and 17
exclusive ways of measuring multimorbidity or comorbidity respectively.
The number of medical conditions included in these measurements varied
from 4 to 102 \citeyearpar{RN34}. Most indices are developed from
secondary care populations but many have been adapted for other
populations including primary care \citep{RN34, RN29}.

There are two main ways of measuring multimorbidity: simple disease
counts or using an index which applies weights to either prescribed
medications or medical conditions and other factors in an attempt to
explain severity of illness \citep{RN16, RN34, RN29}. In primary care
research, the most frequently used measurement is simple disease counts
\citep{RN29}. This may because of the ease with which it can be
administered compared to more complex indices such as the Charlson index
\citep{RN339} or Chronic Disease Score \citep{RN340} and their
variations. Despite the large number of multimorbidity indices
available, Huntley et al \citeyearpar{RN29} cite evidence that suggests
simple counts of diseases or medications are almost as effective as the
more complex indices at predicting mortality or health care use in the
primary care setting. However, when aiming to predict mortality in
Primary Care, Huntley et al \citeyearpar{RN29} recommend the best
measurement of multimorbidity to be provided by the Charlson index
\citep{RN339} and its variations. Measurement of multimorbidity in
relation to primary care healthcare use can be predicted with
equivalence by either; the Adjusted Clinical Group system \citep{RN341},
the Charlson index \citep{RN339}, or disease counts \citep{RN29}.
Disease counts were also found by Huntley et al \citeyearpar{RN29} to
have good evidence to suggest they provide a robust measure of
multimorbidity in relation to Quality of Life, as does the Charlson
index \citep{RN339}. A count of medicines was found to be a good
predictor of primary care use and mortality in a more recent paper
\citep{RN247}. In their paper, Perkins et al \citeyearpar{RN78} argue
that indices developed in the secondary care setting, such as the
Charlson index, should be used with caution in other settings despite
adaptions. More recently, Wallace et al \citeyearpar{RN228} found little
difference between simple (count) and complex (index) measures when
predicting hospital admission but noted that all measures of
multimorbidity alone were poor predictors of the outcome.

An emerging method of measuring multimorbidity is to identify clusters
of medical conditions that co-exist in individuals at rates higher than
would be expected - or non-random prevalence. Recent research and
academic discussion suggests identification of disease clusters may
enable clearer answers to clinically relevant research questions than
currently employed measures
\citetext{\citealp{RN96}; \citealp[RN109;][]{RN98}; \citealp{RN99}; \citealp{RN188}; \citealp{RN31}; \citealp{RN64}}.
Statistical techniques employed in attempts to identify such clusters
include: factor analysis, cluster analysis, the observed-to-expected
ratio, multiple correspondence analysis \citep{RN98, RN301}, principal
component analysis, latent class analysis \citep{RN109, RN365}, and
machine learning techniques \citep{RN273}. In their systematic review of
clustering methods, Prados-Torres et al \citeyearpar{RN98} found wide
variations in approaches to clustering and characteristics of
populations studied. As opposed to many of the studies included in the
review, they recommend future attempts at clustering diseases use:
population-sized datasets, statistical techniques that are suited to the
dichotomous nature of diagnostic variables, and large numbers of
conditions from which to form clusters \citep{RN98}. Prados-Torres et al
\citeyearpar{RN98} identified three groups of patterns common to all
included studies in their review despite marked heterogeneity namely;
cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, mental health conditions, and
musculoskeletal disorders. Whilst identification of groups may have some
benefit in terms of identifying causal mechanisms between diseases,
whether they are useful or meaningful in clinical terms is a matter of
debate.

\subsection{Epidemiology}\label{subsec:mm-epi}

Sections \ref{subsec:mm-defs} and \ref{subsec:mm-measures} describe the
wide variations in definitions and measures of multimorbidity. It is,
therefore, unsurprising that there is marked heterogeneity in reports of
multimorbidity prevalence. Fortin et al \citeyearpar{RN56} illustrate
this by reporting variations in the prevalence of multimorbidity from
3.5\% to 98.5\% across 21 studies included in their systematic review.
The variation in findings is explained by the vastly different
populations, settings, data collection techniques, and definitions of
multimorbidity used by included studies. A more recent systematic review
concentrating on primary care populations and aiming to describe
prevalence, causes and patterns of multimorbidity \citep{RN15} found
reports of multimorbidity prevalence between 12.9\% and 95.1\%. Similar
variations in definitions, measures and populations were found. The
number of conditions used to estimate multimorbidity prevalence varied
between 5 and 335 \citep{RN15}. In an attempt to standardise conditions
to be considered using international disease classification labels, a
more recent paper included 60 conditions \citep{RN300}. Van den Akker et
al {[}-RN91{]} highlighted the complications that can arise when
attempting to measure prevalence of multimorbidity and suggest that
certain decisions made in study design will depend on the specific
question being interrogated by researchers (e.g.~the number of diseases
to include in the measure of multimorbidity or the age-range of the
sample). The systematic reviews of Violan et al \citeyearpar{RN15} and
Fortin et al \citeyearpar{RN56} may reflect the varying decisions made
by research teams in study design. Despite the difficulties in
synthesizing evidence on heterogeneous studies, Violan et al
\citeyearpar{RN15} found strong relationships between multimorbidity
and: age, female gender, low socioeconomic status, and mental health
across studies in their review.

\subsection{Summary}\label{subsec:mm-summary}

Multimorbidity is most commonly defined as the presence (or
co-occurrence) of 2 or more long-term conditions in an individual.
Debate continues as to the type and number of long-term conditions that
should be included to provide a meaningful concept for individuals,
clinicians and healthcare organisations. The lack of a standard
definition is mirrored in the myriad ways of measuring multimorbidity
with various counts, indices, and clusters. Despite this, evidence
suggests multimorbidity is increasing in prevalence and has a strong
socioeconomic pattern. As a result, policy needs to be tailored to
account for the complex needs of the increasing numbers of people with
multimorbidity.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:lit-review-conclusion}

Conclusion of chapter \ref{ch:lit-review}

Access to social care is influenced in 2 main ways - allocation of
resources \emph{to} providers and distribution of services \emph{within}
providers. Theory and evidence suggest inequitable access possible.

Major policy shift to integrate health and social care services
internationally. One of main drivers increase in older population -
services currently disjointed for this group. Two-thirds over 65s have
multimorbidity and associated poorer outcomes - with social gradient.

Understanding how this population access social care, therefore, vitally
important and under-researched.

Does an inverse \emph{social} care law exist? i.e.~Does the allocation
of resources (via funding formulae) to Local Authorities negatively
impact on those areas with higher need?

Furthermore, does access to social care vary across Local Authorities -
is there a ``postcode lottery'' in terms of service provision i.e.~does
application of eligibility criteria depend on where you live?

Is multimorbidity status associated with levels of social care provided
within \emph{and} across local authorities?

Important to understand how access to social care influences health care
use and mortality - do those with multimorbidity and social care have
different outcomes from those with multimorbidity and no social care?

\chapter{Measuring Multimorbidity}\label{ch:clustering}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:clust-intro}

As Chapter \ref{ch:lit-review} showed, multimorbidity can be defined as
the presence of two or more chronic health conditions within an
individual \citep{RN226}. It is associated with higher mortality
\citep{RN81}, increased use of health care \citep{RN81, RN22},
psychological distress \citep{RN243}, worse quality of life
\citep{RN241, RN242}, and worse functional status \citep{RN40}. It not
only affects older people but has been observed in greater absolute
numbers in those under the age of 65 and affects those with lower
socioeconomic status disproportionately \citep{RN33}. As the proportion
of older people in the population increases, multimorbidity is expected
to affect increasing numbers of people in the future
\citep{RN155, RN288}.

Many of the negative outcomes associated with mulitmorbidity are due to
the structure of healthcare delivery which tends to concentrate
treatment goals towards single diseases \citep[\citet{RN290}]{RN155}. As
a result healthcare for individuals with multimorbidity can, at best,
preferentially treat one disease to the detriment of others or, at
worst, cause harm and affect patient safety e.g.~through medication
interactions \citep{RN289}.

Epidemiological research into multimorbidity has tended to count numbers
or report proportions of health conditions. There is, however, marked
heterogeneity in the population considered and the number of diseases
included in measurement. As a result, prevalence rates of multimorbidity
have been shown by systematic reviews to vary widely in the general
population from 13.1\% - 71\% \citep{RN56} and 12.9\% - 95.1\%
\citep{RN15}. There has been little research into the prevalence of
combinations of diseases and non-random, co-occurrence of diseases
partly due to the high number of theoretical combinations meaning large
samples and complex calculations are required \citep{RN91, RN187}. More
recent research has applied a variety of statistical techniques to
overcome this problem \citep{RN98}.

Identification of non-random co-occurrence of health conditions is
important for a number of reasons; a) to gain a better understanding of
the complicated nature of multimorbidity, b) to help assess the impact
multimorbidity has on health outcomes, c) to help assess the
sociodemographic differences in prevalence of multimorbidity which could
have implications for health policy and the delivery of health services,
and d) unexpected non-random associations could prompt further research
into possible causal mechanisms for the association.

The objective of this chapter was to apply a novel two-way clustering
framework to a large dataset based on the Scottish population, The
framework aims to identify clusters of the most significant non-random
co-occurrence of health conditions and multimorbidity patterns among
individuals \citep{RN72}. The specific aims were to a) Identify
non-random associations of health conditions from the dataset,
b)identify if meaningful, homogeneous sub-groups of individuals
according to groups on non-random conditions can be formed, c) assess
the sociodemographic make-up of identified clusters.

\section{Background}\label{sec:clust-background}

Previous clustering attempts in the field of multimorbidity have
employed a number of different statistical techniques including; factor
analysis, cluster analysis, the observed to expected ratio, multiple
correspondence analysis \citep{RN98}, principal component analysis, and
latent class analysis \citep{RN109}. Each of these techniques is a
variant of latent variable modelling where clusters are deemed
unobserved, or latent, variables that can be measured indirectly
depending on the values of two or more observed variables \citep{RN291}.
In their systematic review of clustering techniques, Prados-Torres et al
\citeyearpar{RN98} found marked heterogeneity in the numbers of diseases
included in analyses, populations studied, and resulting clusters of
conditions. The authors recommended that future attempts at clustering
should be conducted using large numbers of diseases and in
population-based datasets as opposed to sub-groups of populations.

An important decision in any clustering research is which statistical
technique to apply to a given dataset. Collins \& Lanza
\citeyearpar{RN291} argue that when the latent variable (cluster) and
the observed variables used to identify the latent variable are
categorical in nature, Latent Class Analysis (LCA), a version of a
finite mixture model, is an appropriate statistical technique to employ.
Other techniques such as factor or cluster analysis rely on latent
and/or observed variables being continuous in nature \citep{RN291}. The
aim of this chapter is to identify whether homogeneous sub-groups of
individuals can be identified from a dataset of diseases represented by
binary, categorical data. Such sub-groups would also be categorical in
nature suggesting LCA is an appropriate technique to apply.

The limitation to LCA is that as the number of observed variables
increases it becomes more difficult for the LCA model to be well
identified \citep{RN291}. This is because the first step of LCA is to
create a contingency table of all possible combinations of outcomes. For
example, in a simple dataset with two binary Yes/No variables there are
\(2^{2} = 4\) potential response outcomes; No/No, Yes/No, No/Yes, and
Yes/Yes. In the example of the dataset used in the current chapter with
40 health conditions recorded as binary variables the number of cells in
the contingency table will contain \(2^{40}\) (over 1 trillion) cells.
This makes good model identification highly unlikely. Ideally the ratio
of \(n/W\) where \(n\) denotes the sample size and \(W\) denotes the
number of potential response outcomes should be as high as possible
\citep{RN291}. When this ratio is very small there are only two options
to overcome the problem, ``\ldots{}increase the amount of known
information or reduce the amount of unknown information.'' \citep[
:93]{RN291}

In response to the ``high-dimensional'' problem created when trying to
identify latent variables from health datasets with large numbers of
diseases, Ng \citeyearpar{RN72} proposed a two-way model to identify
multimorbidity clusters. The first step of this method is to ``clump''
diseases in the dataset into statistically correlated groups of
conditions thereby reducing the number of variables and therefore the
size of contingency table of potential responses. This first step is
described in more detail in Ng et al \citeyearpar{RN225}. The second
step of the method then aims to identify latent groups of individuals
based on response patterns to these ``clumped'' groups with a finite
mixture model similar to LCA \citep{RN72}. This technique was applied to
an Australian national health survey which contained self-reported
responses of the presence of 24 physical and mental health conditions
with full results detailed in Ng \citeyearpar{RN72}. The aim of this
chapter is to identify whether this technique is valid in a much larger
dataset of administrative health data.

\section{Methods}\label{sec:clust-methods}

\subsection{Data}\label{subsec:clust-data}

In Scotland, much multimorbidity research has been informed by the
Scottish Programme for Improving Clinical Effectiveness in Primary Care
(SPICE-PC) dataset \citep{RN292, RN33, RN159, RN148}. Diagnostic data
from the year 2007 is available on 1,754,133 people in Scotland drawn
from 314 general practices. The anonymised dataset has information on
the presence of 32 physical and 8 mental health conditions (?? add box
with list of diseases??) in addition to age, gender and deprivation
index data. Diagnostic data is derived from codes entered into IT
systems in General Practices and prescription data. A full description
of the 40 included diseases and the methods used to classify them is
available as supplementary information in Barnett et al
\citeyearpar{RN33}. The analysis for this chapter was restricted to
adults over the age of 18 resulting in n=1,426,196. (10\% sample of this
so far!!) Ethical approval for secondary analysis of the SPICE-PC
dataset using LCA was granted by the Research Ethics Committee of the
College of Social Sciences at the University of Glasgow on 29/04/2016.

\subsection{Analysis}\label{subsec:clust-analysis}

The two-way method proposed by Ng \citeyearpar{RN72} was applied to the
above dataset of 40 health conditions. Firstly groups of conditions that
co-occur are identified and then latent groups of individuals are
identified using a mixture model approach. To identify the groups of
conditions that co-occur the method aims to calculate the significant
pairwise multimorbidity between all conditions. The asymmetric Somer's D
statistic was used to quantify the degree of random co-morbidity with
all pairs of health conditions. Significance of the Somer's D statistic
for each pair of conditions was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure \citep{RN293} to control the false discovery rate (FDR) with
\(\alpha\) = 0.001. Diseases were then clustered into overlapping groups
using a ``clumping'' procedure based on the technique described by
Jardin \& Robson \citeyearpar{RN294} and fully described as equation 11
in Ng et al \citeyearpar{RN225}. The strength of multimorbidity in each
cluster was calculated using the average pairwise Somer's D statistics
of disease within the group. From these overlapping groups,
non-overlapping groups of diseases were created using an amended version
of the algorithm specified in Ng \citeyearpar{RN72}:-

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Name the cluster with the highest strength as the first group and then
  remove its member health conditions in all subsequent clusters with
  smaller strength. Each member in a cluster must have the condition
  with which the pairwise concordance statistic is maximum in the same
  cluster;
\item
  Repeat (1) for the next cluster and name it as a group if it is not
  `singular' (singular cluster is defined as a cluster consisting of a
  single health condition);\\
\item
  If a group is formed in (2), remove its member health conditions in
  all subsequent clusters with smaller strength or singular clusters;
\item
  Repeat (2) and (3) until all clusters are visited;
\item
  Put the condition in a singular cluster into a predefined group where
  more than half of the member conditions are significantly comorbid
  with the condition;
\item
  Name those remaining singular clusters as a singular group.
\end{enumerate}

A matrix was then created assigning a score to individual observations
for each identified non-overlapping group. Scores were assigned as:-

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  1 for having no diseases within the group
\item
  2 for having one of the diseases in the group
\item
  3 for having 2 or more diseases within the group.
\end{itemize}

In the second part of the analysis a mixture-model of multivariate
generalised Bernoulli distributions was applied to the matrix of these
scores in order to identify latent groups of individuals according to
response patterns to the score matrix. The most appropriate number of
latent groups to fit the dataset was determined by the lowest Bayesian
Information Criterion (BIC) and substantive theoretical analysis. Models
with 3 to 9 latent groups were compared to find best model fit. Each
observation was then assigned to the latent group for which the
posterior probability was highest. Descriptive analysis of
sociodemographic difference in latent group was then employed to
identify patterns in groupings.

All statistical analysis was completed using R version 3.3.3
\citep{RN295}. Two-way clustering was conducted with amended code
provided by Ng\citeyearpar{RN72}. Data manipulation and visualisation
was conducted using tidyverse packages \citep{RN296} and the corrplot
package.

\section{Results}\label{sec:clust-results}

With \(\alpha\) controlled at 0.001, 143 of a possible 780 pairwise
correlations proved to be significant. A matrix showing all
statistically significant correlations is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:corrplot}. The number of expected false positives for 143 pairs
is less than 1.

\subsection{Grouping diseases}\label{subsec:clust-grouping}

Using the ``clumping'' procedure detailed in Ng \citeyearpar{RN72},
Thirty-eight overlapping groups of conditions were found as shown in
Table \ref{tab:overlap}

  }
\end{table}

Six diseases; Epilepsy, Learning Disability, Sinusitis, Crohns,
Anorexia, Psoriasis/Eczema did not have strong enough pairwise
correlations to be included in any of the 38 groups. Thirteen
non-overlapping groups were derived from the results of the clumping
method using the algorithm described above and named according to the
characteristics of the member disease in the groups as shown in Table
\ref{tab:no-overlap}.

A further four diseases; Diverticular disease, Prostate, IBS, and
Dyspepsia were excluded from the non-overlapping groups. These four
conditions did not appear in any groups with the diseases with which
they had strongest pairwise correlation, a condition that had to be met
in the first stage of the algorithm described above.

\subsection{Grouping individuals}\label{subsec:clust-clustering}

Individuals were assigned a score depending on the number of diseases
they had in each of the non-overlapping groups according to the criteria
described above. The finite mixture model of multivariate generalised
Bernoulli distributions was then applied to this dataset in order to
identify latent groups of individuals depending on their scores for each
of the 13 groups, based on presence of 30 diseases. BIC scores suggested
the model for nine latent groups had best fit to the data. The
nine-group model was compared with the model with second-lowest value of
BIC, that for eight latent groups. However, despite offering a more
parsimonious solution, the eight-group model did not provide a more
substantive theoretical fit to the data. Thus, the nine-group model was
deemed best fit and analysed further.

Item-response probabilities for the nine-group model are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:item-response}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/item-response.png}
  \caption{Item response probabilities for nine latent group model}
  \label{fig:item-response}
\end{figure}

Each latent group was labelled according to these item response
probabilities as follows;

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Latent Group 1. \textbf{Well}. High probabilities of having no
  diseases in any of the groups.
\item
  Latent Group 2. \textbf{Cardiovascular only}. Item response in this
  Latent group have more than 50\% chance of having at least 1 condition
  from the Cardiovascular group. High probabilities of having no
  diseases in any of the other groups.
\item
  Latent Group 3. \textbf{Cancer}. Individuals in this group have almost
  100\% probability of having had cancer in last 5 years. Weak
  probabilities across some other groups.
\item
  Latent Group 4. \textbf{Mental Health/Pain} High probability of having
  at least one diseases from Pain/MS group and at least one disease from
  Mental Health/Liver group.
\item
  Latent Group 5. \textbf{Mental and Physical Multimorbidity} High
  probabilities of having at least 1 cardiovascular, diabetes/stroke,
  Pain/MS, and Mental health/Liver disease. This group also has the
  highest probability across latent groups for having 1 respiratory
  disease.
\item
  Latent Group 6 \textbf{Physical Multimorbidity} High probability of a
  least one cardiovascular disease and one of Diabetes/Stroke.
\item
  Latent Group 7. \textbf{Physical multimorbidity (Strong Cardio)}.
  Similar to Latent group 6 but individuals in this group are more
  likely to have 2 or more cardiovascular diseases.
\item
  Latent Group 8. \textbf{Dementia with Mental/Physical MM} Individuals
  in this latent group have almost 100\% probability of having dementia
  or Parkinson's. Also highly likely to have at least one Cardiovascular
  disease and mildly raised probability of having mental health or
  psychosis diseases.
\item
  Latent Group 9. \textbf{Mental Health only}. High probability of
  having a least 1 of the Mental Health/Liver group diseases. Also
  mildly raised probabilities in the Psychosis and Sciz\_Bipolar groups.
\end{itemize}

Proportionate size of each of the assigned latent variable groups is
shown in Figure \ref{fig:group-props}.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/props.png}
  \caption{Latent Group Proportions}
  \label{fig:group-props}
\end{figure}

The ``Well'' latent group was by far the largest group with almost 70\%
of individuals within it. The other groups formed much smaller
proportions of the data.

\subsection{Sociodemographic breakdown of latent groups}\label{subsec:clust-ses}

Each of the Histograms of Age for each of the latent groups shown in
Figure \ref{fig:lg-by-age} show variation in distribution. The ``Well''
and ``Mental Health only'' groups have a much younger age distribution
compared to the other groups. The ``Dementia'' group has a much older
distribution.

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/lg-by-age.png}
  \caption{Histograms of Age, by Latent Group}
  \label{fig:lg-by-age}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:lg-by-sex} shows higher proportions of males in the
``Physical MM'' latent group. The ``Well'' and ``Physical MM high
Cardio'' groups have even splits by gender. All other groups have higher
proportions of females.

Figure \ref{fig:lg-by-dep} shows distribution of deprivation across
latent groups by Carstairs Decile. There are clear gradients in the
``Mental Health \& Pain'', ``Ment/Phys MM'', and ``Mental Health only''
groups with much higher numbers of people in Decile 10 (most deprived)
areas.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:clust-discussion}

When proposing the two-way clustering method, Ng \citeyearpar{RN72}
applied the technique to Australian survey data of 24 self-reported
diseases from n=8841 respondents. These were ``clumped'' into nine
non-overlapping groups of diseases with four latent groups of
individuals being identified by the mixture model. Given the different
classification of diseases, the nature of how data were collected, and
the different populations, it is unsurprising that results from the
present study are markedly different. What is of interest is whether the
technique provided a meaningful representation of the data which can be
used to improve the understanding of multimorbidity within this
population.

The first step of the two-way clustering technique resulted in 13
non-overlapping groups being formed. As a result of this process, ten of
the diseases recorded in the dataset were excluded from the final
groups. Six diseases; Epilepsy, Learning Disability, Sinusitis, Crohns,
Anorexia, and Psoriasis/Eczema did not have strong enough pairwise
Somer's D correlation statistics with any other disease to be included
in the non-overlapping ``clumping'' procedure. A further four diseases;
Diverticular, Prostate, IBS, and Dyspepsia did not appear in any
non-overlapping group with the disease with which they had the strongest
Somer's D correlation. Identifying which diseases do not co-occur at
non-random levels is a particularly interesting finding and adds to the
debate about which diseases should be included in any multimorbidity
measure.{[}be explicit -- do you think this suggests we shouldn't count
these 10 in any MM measure and, if so, why? -NB{]} Of the 40 diseases
present in the SPICE-PC dataset, in this analysis, only 30 diseases
co-occurred with enough statistical power to be added to non-overlapping
disease groups and considered in the mixture model.

Past research has highlighted associations between; mental health and
thyroid problems, mental health and pain, and diseases associated with
the metabolic syndrome \citep{RN98}. As shown in figure 1, there is no
pairwise correlation between any mental health diseases and thyroid
disorders in the present study. Pain is associated with a large number
of conditions, including mental health diseases. Diseases associated
with metabolic syndrome such as, hypertension, coronary heart disease,
diabetes, stroke, and heart failure all show correlations with each
other to varying degrees. Prados-Torres et al \citeyearpar{RN98} also
identified associations between Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD) and Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) with mental health
diseases. No associations with between any respiratory disease and
mental health diseases is apparent in figure 1. The SPICE-PC dataset
does not record GORD, however Dyspepsia may be considered a similar
diagnosis and has pairwise correlations with both Depression and
Anxiety.

The non-overlapping disease groups were named according to the
characteristics of the diseases present in each, however many diseases
appeared in groups that may not come from similar aetiology. The groups
reflect diseases that commonly co-occur and therefore do not always fit
into clinically recognisable groups. Individuals are scored as to the
number of diseases they have from each group. This results in a loss of
some information but the advantage of this method is that it reduces the
number of variables in the dataset making the likelihood of identifying
a good mixture model much more likely.

Applying a mixture model of multivariate generalised Bernoulli
distributions to these 13 non-overlapping disease groups identified nine
latent groups as described above. These groups are clinically
recognisable with some showing presence of diseases from only one
disease group and others illustrating a more multimorbid population.
Clear distinctions between mental and physical disease are made enabling
individuals to have diseases from both groups. In their systematic
review of clustering studies of multimorbidity, Prados-Torres et al
\citeyearpar{RN98} found that included studies reported between three
and twenty diseases clusters. From these they found three most common
groups of diseases; cardiovascular, mental health, and musculoskeletal.
Latent groups in the current study also contain cardiovascular and
mental health elements, although they do not reflect any groups that
could be identified as musculoskeletal.

Clear sociodemographic patterns were identified in the latent groups.
Those classified as belonging to a latent group with mental health
involvement such as; mental health/pain, mental and physical
multimorbidity, or mental health only, were more likely to be female and
from lower deprivation deciles. Two similar latent groups; physical
multimorbidity and physical multimorbidity high cardiovascular, had
clear age differences with the former more likely to have younger male
individuals assigned to it. These findings are similar to simple
analyses of the same dataset which identified those in the most deprived
areas being more likely to develop physical and mental health
multimorbidity 10-15 years earlier than their more affluent peers
\citep{RN33}.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{subsec:clust-limitations}

The two-step method proposed by Ng \citeyearpar{RN72} enables reduction
of dimensions in datasets with large numbers of disease variables making
model good identification of mixture models more likely. This, however,
results in a loss of detail making interpretation of results more
difficult. Report of the item-response probabilities shown in figure 4
identifies that individuals have a probability of having none, one, or
two of the diseases in any group. It is impossible to identify exactly
which diseases. Hypertension with 13.4\% of individuals is the highest
reported disease in the SPICE-PC . To what degree this accounts for
individuals having one disease in the cardiovascular group across latent
classes is unknown.

This is particularly a problem as the non-overlapping groups formed by
the two-way clustering method do not always follow recognised clinical
groupings. For example, Rheumatoid arthritis is found in the
cardiovascular group despite being a connective tissue disorder. It is
the only disease in the group that does not directly affect the
cardiovascular system. The reason it is found in this group may be due
to the association of increased NSAID use with cardiovascular outcomes
(ref) resulting in frequent co-occurrence. As some latent groups are
classified as ``Cardiovascular only'', there is a possibility that small
numbers of people with only Rheumatoid Arthritis are misclassified.
{[}This is could be down to nomenclature and I maybe need to revisit
group names. It does not get rid of the problem that for the group with
high probs for the cardio/rheum disease we can't distinguish which
disease the individual has{]}

When clustering individuals, fitting a finite mixture model of
multivariate generalised Bernoulli distributions makes the assumption
that the indicator variables used to identify latent groups are
independent. In a dataset containing medical conditions such as
e.g.~Hypertension and Coronary Heart Disease, or Atrial Fibrillation and
Stroke, this assumption is clearly violated. However, ignoring the
independence assumption for multivariate categorical variables often
results in better fit than when more complicated techniques are applied
to account for non-independence of indicator variables
\citep{RN72, RN298, RN297}.

Results presented here account for 10\% of the SPICE-PC dataset due to
the heavy computational requirements of fitting the finite mixture
model. Confirmation of results on the whole dataset is required.

\subsection{Future research}\label{subsec:clust-future}

Sociodemographic comparison in the current study was limited to
visualisation of histograms. More detailed reports of measures of
central tendency and comparison of latent groups with sociodemographic
variables such as Carstairs decile with logistic regression is
warranted. SPICE-PC data also contains variables on lifestyle factors
such as smoking status and alcohol intake. These variables should be
included in further comparisons.

A further calculation offered in the two-way clustering technique
\citep{RN72} is the calculation of a multimorbidity score to each latent
group and to each individual in the dataset based on their disease
profile and posterior probabilities. Such as score would be continuous
in nature and would offer the benefit of comparison with
sociodemographic variables such Carstairs score or Age. Such comparisons
would be amenable to well-recognised regression techniques.

Part 1 of the two-step method involves reducing the dimensions of the
dataset to be amenable to mixture modelling. Using the outcome of this
first step, the non-overlapping groups, Ng's technique for clustering
individuals should be compared to Latent Class Analysis which is also a
suitable technique for the nature of the data \citep{RN291}. In
supplementary material, NG \citeyearpar{RN72} compared his two-step
method with Latent Profile Analysis and found it inferior to the
two-step method. Latent Profile Analysis is a mixture model for
continuous indicator variables \citep{RN291} and would not be suitable
for the SPICE-PC dataset.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:clust-conclusion}

A novel two-step method for clustering health conditions and individuals
was applied to large, population representative, dataset of
administrative primary care data. The method found 10 of the 40
conditions in the dataset did not co-occur with other diseases strongly
enough to included in further analysis. Thirty conditions were
``clumped'' into 13 groups of commonly co-occurring conditions and
individuals in the dataset were assigned a score depending on the number
of disease within each group they had. From this information nine latent
groups of individuals were identified with a finite mixture model. These
groups reflected varying degrees of physical, mental and physical/mental
multimorbidity and showed sociodemographic patterning.
