\thispagestyle{empty}

\section{Key Findings}

\subsection{Multimorbidity and social care}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Multimorbidity influences receipt of social care. 
\item ..though age is the biggest factor - likely due to frailty??
\item What about most deprived? less likely to make it to old age and lower disability-free life expectancy - does this point to unmet need?
\item APEs show effects *after* adjusting for other variables (and interactions) important to discuss what they mean and how i can compare across models. 
\item Lower rates of receipt in subset 2, but APEs similar across subsets. Edin and Glas in subset 2
\item Female effect 4\% diff in probability - more likely to live alone?
\item Magnitude of effects important. 9+ meds == 80-84 ages. i.e. high multimorbidity same effect as aging 15-20 years
\item Fluctuating APEs for councils to do with baseline level of reference council also fluctuating. Again - *very small changes in APE*
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Renfrewshire}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Brief overview of discussion from chapter
\item Also discuss implicit finding that finite number of places for social care in Renfrew. Allocation according to \emph{resource} not \emph{need}. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unplanned hospital admission}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Overall smaller magnitude of effects
\item High MM largest magnitude effect. Linear effect through groups
\item Age not as big a driver as SC
\item SC + USC drive admission. Likely means people with high needs use large amounts of \emph{all} services. 
\item Link to "intensification" of SC in lit review. Numbers now so small, can't assess if protective effect for those with less need.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Descriptives}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Medicines decent measure of MM. Clear effects on SC and admissions
\item SIMD effect of MM reduces with age
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Social Care data}\label{sec:disc-sc-data}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Discuss quality and collection of SCS (place this nationally/internationally). Is there good sc data anywhere???
\item What is good/bad - What have I learned?
\item Consider quantifying home care \emph{plus} alarm/telecare users
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Linked Administrative Data Research}\label{sec:disc-admin-data}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Discuss process of obtaining and analysing linked data. Potentially useful for sg and others
\item Timeframe!! Probabaly not a good idea to try this for a PhD given timelines
\item Safe Haven. SDC and software upgrades
\item Suprevisors need to get used to appraising work *in* safe haven. 600 + outputs SDC. Also means format of how to appraise needs agreed. html??
\item Good things???
\item Point to move to re-use data rather than obtain-and-destroy approach
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparisons to previous research}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Bardsley and SR of H \& SC studies
\item Kent economic paper
\item MM stuff
\item medicine counts as MM - Brilleman and Salisbury
\end{itemize}

\section{Strengths and Limitations}

\subsection{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Large, population sized linkage
\item Marginal effects
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Not really assessed Access to social care (mention time constraint?)
\item Census week for home care. Compare 2013/14 and later years in table 5.1
\item Linkage of SCS not consistent - difficult to make broad comparisons. Attempted to offset by subsetting. Home care stable though falling in SCS - why?
\item No measure for living alone
\item MM measure not validated - limited due to lack of access to PC data, Also means cannot address important MM questions as laid by AMS e.g. "Which clusters result in the greatest healthcare utilisation and greatest cost?"
\end{itemize}


\section{Implications}

\subsection{LA Variation}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item MM effect on SC raises important message for policymakers. 
\item Strong argument for universal PC is that it improves access and therefore chance to prevent ill health etc [@RN599, 7]. (although ICL still present)
\item Social care is not universal therefore has poorer access therefore any hope of preventative care is unlikely
\item *If* care was broadend - would need an accurate measure of *need* How should this be defined? How should care be allocted due to it?
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommended future actions and research}

\subsection{Future research}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Measure \emph{Longitudinal} changes in social care and impact on admission/usc
\item Break down SC data - home care/telecare influence on outcomes
\item Utilise USC data better - include A \& E, NHS24 etc etc
\item Check post-doc list
\item Mortality
\item Further investigate medicines as measure of MM - try chapter counts [@RN228] or continuous rather than categorical
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A good title}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Broaden timeframe of SCS collection
\item Support LAs to provide either CHI or easily provide all ID data for linkage
\item Better access to Primary Care data for MM research
\end{itemize}
