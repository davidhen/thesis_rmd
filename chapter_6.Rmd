\chapter{Renfrewshire Council Exploratory Project}\label{ch:renfrew}

\section{Introduction}\label{renf-intro}

As described in Chapter \ref{ch:data}, the Social Care Survey (SCS) is collected annually by the Scottish Government and provides a snapshot of individuals receiving social care in all 32 Scottish local authorities during a census week - usually including the date the 31st of March [@RN487]. The cross-sectional nature of this data means it does not identify every individual that receives social care in any given financial year. This has implications for research projects using the SCS and the statistical analyses that can be applied to SCS data when linked with other sources of information. For example, predictions of unscheduled health care use are only likely to be accurate in a short time-window close to the census week. 

In order to gain a better understanding of the data the SCS captures (and the data it does not) an exploratory study was conducted to analyse social care data for indiviudals from one local authority only. This project aimed to analyse complete social care data for all individuals over a ten-year period to compare individuals receiving care in the census week with individuals who receive care in the same financial year but would not have been captured by the SCS census.

As social care data in Scotland has rarely been used for research purposes, this exploratory project also offered the opportunity to assess the format, content, and suitability of the data from a research perspective. Ideally, data would be analysed from a number of local authorities for comparison however, as described below, aquiring sensitive data of this nature is a lenghty and complicated process relying heavily on the goodwill of the participating local authority. Despite early intentions to approach multiple local authorities practical considerations limited the project to data collected from Renfrewshire Council. 

\section{Background}\label{sec:renf-background}

The decision to approach Renfrewshire council as a potential source of data was due to convenience given previous cooperation between the council and UBDC on other projects. Glasgow City council were also approached but preliminary discussions suggested that whilst the purpose of proposed research was supported, the council was unlikely to be able to provide sufficient resource to facilitate data sharing. Preliminary meetings with data analysts from Renfrewshire council confirmed that data could be provided to facilitate the proposed research and the formal process of obtaining data using UBDC's controlled data service was instigated in April 2016. 

Renfrewshire council area accounts for 3.2\% of the total population of Scotland and has a slightly larger proportion of individuals aged over 60 compared to the rest of the country (24.4\% v 24.2\%) [@RN492]. The mortality rate is also higher than recorded for the rest of Scotland (10.9\% v 10.3\%) with the main causes of death being cancer, circulatory diseases, and respiratory diseases [@RN492]. Life expectancy at birth is lower than the Scottish average in the Renfrewshire council area for both males and females (75.9 v 77.1 \& 80.6 v 81.1) [@RN492]. Sixty-three percent of dwellings in Renfrewshire fall into the lowest council tax bands A-C [@RN492] which is a higher than the ratio seen in the whole country (61\%) [@RN493]. Of all datazones in the Renfrewshire council area, 37.3\% fall into the most deprived 30\% of Scottish datazones - the ninth highest rate out of 32 local authorities [@RN494]. Datazones in the Renfrewshire council area show marked differences in SIMD scores with some of the most and least deprived datazones in the whole of Scotland [@RN494]. 

In terms of social care, the 2017 SCS [@RN499, supp.charts] shows that the proportion of over 65s receiving home care provided or adminstered by Renfrewshire dipped a little between 2011 and 2015 but has nearly returned to 2010 levels (52.4 per thousand in 2010, 49.4 per thousand in 2017). Historically, this is lower than levels seen across Scotland as a whole although national levels are now very similar to those seen in Renfrew (60.8 per thousand in 2010 to 48.9 per thousand in 2017). The absolute numbers of over 65s receiving home care in Renfrewshire in the 2010 census week was 1812 versus 1603 in the 2017 census [@RN499, supp.charts].

More recent versions of the SCS collect information on home care (such as personal care or reablement), housing support and meals services provided during the census week. In addition, data on services such as community alarm, telecare, social worker, and self-directed support that are provided at anytime during the financial year is also collected [@RN499]. The purpose of the exploratory project was to compare service provision of those services collected in the census week. As the vast majority of this data is focussed on home care services the analysis concentrates on this service only. Home care refers to services received in the home such as personal care or reablement (described in section \ref{subsec:access-sc-defs}). 

\subsection{Research Questions}\label{subsec:renfrew-qs}

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item How does home care use vary within and across financial years 2006/07 - 2015/16 in the Renfrewshire council area?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods}\label{sec:renf-methods}

\subsection{Data}\label{subsec:renf-methods-data}

As with all services provided by Renfrewshire council, home care data is collected to ensure efficient mananagement of the service and as evidence of service provision [@RN495]. Recording of indivdual episodes of care also helps with budgetary management of the service.

Data provided for the purposes of this exploratory study detailed anonymised information on; how many days per week, how many hours per day, service provider (e.g. local authority or independent provider), type of care (e.g. mainstream or reablement), start date, and end date for every episode of home care delivered to individuals in the Renfrewshire council area between April 2006 and April 2017. Demographic information detailing gender and year of birth was also provided.

As all episodes of home care were delivered over a period of time, data was provided for some packages where the care was first delivered as early as 2004 or as late as Summer 2017 (e.g. a home care episode starting in December 2005 and running to December 2006 was included in the data transfer).  Data detailing information on community alarm and telecare services provided by Renfrewshire council were not analysed as part of this project. 

**Box with description of care types i.e. Care at Home (Mainstream) refers to ...**

The research questions of the main thesis are concerned with adults over the age of 65 in Scotland. For that reason analysis of the exploratory project was subset to also include this age bracket only. An unexpectedly large number of individals (n = 112) had a year of birth recorded as 1900 (compared to n = 68 born between the years 1901 and 1910). A similar phenonmenon was reported in the SCS linkage process (described in chapter \ref{ch:methods}) with the deduction that 1900 was a code for missing data. In this analysis these records were ommited. To protect anonymity individual month and day of birth were not shared meaning age was calculable from year of birth only.  

A number of episodes of care (n = 3604) were found to have the same start and end date - considered to be data entry error when queried with a Renfrewshire council data analyst - and these records were also ommited from analysis. 

Overnight and housing support. 

The SCS requests information on the total hours of home care each indiviudal received during the census week. To replicate this information every episode of care in the exploratory dataset was summarised. For each episode of home care the number of hours per day was multiplied with days per week to give a weekly total of home care hours for each episode. To identify \textit{packages} of home care, episodes of home care with the same start and end date, and of the same home care type, were added together. For example, an indiviudal receiving home care of the type "Care at Home (Mainstream)" with an episode of care lasting 1 hour in the morning for 3 days a week, an episode of care lasting 45 minutes at luchtime 7 days a week, an evening episode of 30 minutes 7 days a week, and nightime episode of 45 mins 7 days a week, would have a total weekly home care hours count of 17 hours per week for that home care type. Finally, the totals for all types of home care were summed to give an overall weekly total. 

\subsection{Analysis}\label{subsec:renf-methods-analysis}

Descriptive statistics of the study cohort measured mean, standard deviation, and median for continous variables and counts with frequency and percentage for categorical variables.

To enable comparison of packages at different time points a time-series was created for the study period 27th March 2006 to 28th March 2016 at weekly intervals. The value of total hours of home care each indiviudal was receiving at each weekly interval time point was identified. From this time series weekly counts of the total number of individuals receiving home care were calculated. Maximum and minimum values, measures of central tendency, and range of these weekly values were compared to the total number of individuals receiving home care in each financial year and visualised. Comparison was also made to the figures returned by Renfrewshire council to the SCS for numbers of indiviudals receiving home care.

For the financial years 2011/12 - 2015/16 (the study period of the main thesis project) data was subset to identify those packages of home care that were "live" during the week including the 31st of March and those that were not "live" i.e. (those that would not have been captured by SCS census). These subsets were the compared by visualising the duration, type, and amount of home care provided in each subset. 

All data cleaning and analysis was conducted using the R labguage and environment for statistical computing version 3.4.0 [@RN295] with packages \texttt{tidyverse} v1.2.0 [@RN296], \texttt{tibbletime} v0.0.2 [@RN496], and \texttt{cowplot} v0.9.0 [@RN497] via the Integrated Development Environment RStudio v ??? [@RN498]. Data was held securely in the safe haven environment described in section \ref{sec:safe-haven}


\subsection{Project approvals and timeline}\label{subsec:renf-methods-approvals}

The exploratory project utilised the controlled data service provided by UBDC and therefore required approval from UBDC's Research Approvals Committee (RAC). This process is more fully explained in section \ref{subsec:rac}. Ethical approval for the study was gained from the University of Glasgow College of Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee on 24/05/2016 *(Appendix A)*. Approval from RAC was gained on 01/06/2016 *(Appendix B)*. 

Following academic and ethical approval the process of obtaining a data sharing agreement (DSA) between the University of Glasgow and Renfrewshire council was instigated. This involved the production of an agreement in principal and privacy impact assessment as a basis for the DSA. This process involved the input of legal teams from both institutions as well as liaision with data analysts at Renfrewshire council and UBDC. The DSA was finally signed on 06/09/2017 with final transfer of data taking place on 21/09/2017. 

\section{Results}\label{sec:renf-results}



\textit{n} individuals received more than 50 hrs of homecare per week during the 10 years representing \textit{n} packages of care. These are likely to be supported accomodation packages etc etc. (cut/paste from analysis re SCS return). These individuals were therefore dropped from analysis and all subsent results are based on \textit{n} number of individuasls with packages less than 50 hrs per week. 

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item There were \textit{n} number of individuals in receiving homecare 2006 - 2016
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:renf-discuss}

Implications - particular focus on variation in care throughout the year and whether care provided in a census week is a robust measure for research purposes (based on Renfrew results)

Limitations - One council only. Different collection and reporting methods across LAs etc etc.
