\chapter{Data}\label{ch:data}

\epigraph{Record linkage refers to a merging that brings together information from two or more sources of data with the object of consolidating facts concerning an individual or an event that are not available in any separate record.}{\textit{[OECD, 2006]}}

Administrative data is data that is generated when individuals use public services [@RN85; @RN352]. This data can describe the provision of a specific service or how that service was administerd [@RN85; @RN352]. As the above definition outlines, record linkage involves joining data about individuals from two or more administrative databases together [@RN279; @RN470] and is being increasingly used in social science research [@RN133; @RN276]. 

There are two main methods of linking data from disparate sources; deterministic matching and probabilistic matching [@RN279; @RN470]. Where differing datasets possess common unique identifiers, determinsitic matching simply links data using this identifier. Probability matching methodology can be employed in the abscence of a common unique identifier [@RN279; @RN470]. Using this method, a probability of two records matching correctly in calculated based on how well the records match based on a set of common partial identifiers such as name, date-of-birth, or postcode [@RN279; @RN470]. 

Scotland is home to some of the best administrative databases in the world [@RN85]. This is particularly due to the high-quality of health datasets that have been collected and maintained for over 40 years [@RN85; @RN470]. Whilst linkage of differing health datasets has become common over this period, new cross-sectoral linkages are beginning to emerge such as health and educational data [@RN471], and health and social care data [@RN132]. These cross-sectoral linkages are providing new insights that have the potential to have lasting impact on policy and provision of services [@RN85; @RN133]. 

\section{Infrastructure}\label{sec:infrastructure}

\subsection{Urban Big Data Centre}\label{subsec:ubdc}

Funding for this PhD was provided by the Scottish Government and the Economic \& Social Research Council (ESRC). The bid for funding was won by the Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC) which is based within the University of Glasgow. UBDC as an organisation is also funded by the ESRC and brings together data scientists and social scientists with research interests relevant to urban living such as; housing, transport, migration, and health [@RN472]. UBDC has six partner universities; Edinburgh, Bristol, Cambridge, Reading, Sheffield, and Illinois-Chicago. It is also one of three UK research institutions that offer help for researchers using linked administrative data - the others being; The Administrative Data Research Network (ADRN) and the Farr Institute. 

The linkage project describe in this thesis was completed with the assistance of UBDC's controlled data service which in turn liaises closely with the electronic Data and Research Innovation Service (eDRIS), provided by the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland (NSS). *More on controlled data plus ref to \ref{subsec:rac}

\subsection{electronic Data and Research Innovation Service (eDRIS)}\label{subsec:edris}

ISD is a subdivision of NHS NSS [@RN324]. NSS is a national NHS Board in its own right and works with the other NHS Boards, particularly the 14 geographic health boards, to provide centralised services such as; procurement, legal support, IT, and public health intelligence [@RN473]. As a division of NSS, ISD provides, among other things, services and support for IT and public health intelligence [@RN324]. eDRIS is part of ISD and is detailed specifically with assisting research using health administrative datasets. Researchers using the eDRIS service have a named research assistant who provides advice on; data sources, study design, the information governance approvals system (described in section \ref{subsec:pbpp}), access to the safe haven environoment (described in section \ref{subsec:safe-haven}), and review of analysis outputs to ensure disclosive information cannot be inferred [@RN324].
