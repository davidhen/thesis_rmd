\section{Introduction}\label{renf-intro}

As described in Section \ref{subsec:source-sc}, the Social Care Survey (SCS) is collected annually by the Scottish Government and provides information on the types and amounts of social care delivered to individuals in all 32 Scottish local authorities. This information is collected in two ways depending on which service an individual may receive. Since 2014/15 the survey has collect data on all individuals who receive a community alarm service, a telecare service, self-directed-support, or assistance via a social or support worker at any time during the financial year. Home care data is collected only for individuals receiving these services during a census week - usually including the date 31\textsuperscript{st} March [@RN487]. Prior to 2014/15, all data was collected for the census week only. The cross-sectional nature of the data collected for home care services means that the SCS does not identify every individual who receives social care in any given financial year. This has implications for the interpretation of research projects using the SCS and the statistical inferences that can be applied to the data when linked with other sources of information. 

This aim of this chapter is therefore to estimate the completeness of the SCS and give an indication of the demographic make-up and type of care received to those who are "captured" by the SCS census compared to those who are not. This is done by a descriptive analysis of complete data from one local authority area which also identifies how many more individuals receiving home care would be identified by collecting data from one census quarter, rather than a one census week.

All data relating to home care services from Renfrewshire council were de-identified and transferred securely to a safe haven environment to enable analysis. Information of differing types of home care services were summarised and a weekly time series indicating the amount of service provision in each week for each individual was created for the period April 2006-March 2016. This enabled quantification of the amount of people receiving care in each week, quarter, and financial year, and the total amount of care provided over each financial year.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ren-scs-data} depicts the differing time periods over which variables are collected by more recent versions of the SCS and the proposed one quarter collection of data for financial year 2017/18. The convention in this chapter is to refer to the data collected during the census week collectively as "Home care". This term can, however, refer to a number of services previously described in chapter \ref{ch:lit-review} (table \ref{tab:methods-homecaredefs}) and reprinted in table \ref{tab:renf-homecaredefs}.

Two reasons that individuals may receive home care services but not be captured by the SCS include death before the census week and receipt of short-term home care services over a period not including the census. Whilst it is difficult to quantify numbers of people who fall into the former category with administrative data not linked to death records, this chapter provides some insight into levels of the latter. Given intentions to amalgamate the SCS with administrative resources collected by ISD and move to a one quarter collection of data [@RN500], the exploratory project also aimed to quantify the percentage of all individuals that would be identified by collection of home care data in quarter 4 of each financial year (this quarter was the proposed time period for collection of the 2017/18 censs. Official statistics are expected to be published in April 2019). 

As social care data in Scotland has rarely been used for research purposes, this exploratory project also offered the opportunity to assess the format, content, and suitability of the data from a research perspective. Ideally, data would be analysed from a number of local authorities for comparison. However, as described below, acquiring sensitive data of this nature is a lengthy and complicated process, relying heavily on the goodwill of the participating local authority. Despite early intentions to approach multiple local authorities, practical considerations limited the project to data collected from Renfrewshire Council. 

The decision to approach Renfrewshire Council as a potential source of data was due to convenience given previous cooperation between the council and UBDC on other projects. Another local authority was also approached but preliminary discussions suggested that whilst the purpose of proposed research was supported, the council was unlikely to be able to provide sufficient resource to facilitate data sharing. Preliminary meetings with data analysts from Renfrewshire council confirmed that data could be provided to facilitate the proposed research and the formal process of obtaining data using UBDC's controlled data service was instigated in April 2016. 

Despite there only being a single source of data, Renfrewshire Council offers an excellent location in which to explore the receipt of social care given it is fairly representative of Scotland as a whole. It is the 10\textsuperscript{th} largest local authority with 3.2\% of the total population of the country. It has a similar proportion of individuals aged over 60 compared to the rest of the country (24.4\% v 24.2\%) [@RN492] and the mortality rate is only slightly higher than recorded for the rest of Scotland (10.9\% v 10.3\%). Some of the most and least deprived datazones in the whole of Scotland as well as a spread of urban and rural neighbourhoods are present in the Renfrewshire council area [@RN494].

In terms of social care, the 2017 SCS [@RN499, supp.charts] shows that the proportion of over 65s receiving home care provided or administered by Renfrewshire Council reduced between 2011 and 2015 but has nearly returned to 2010 levels (52.4 per thousand in 2010, 49.4 per thousand in 2017). Historically, this is lower than levels seen across Scotland as a whole, although national levels are now very similar (60.8 per thousand in 2010 to 48.9 per thousand in 2017). The absolute number of over 65s receiving home care in Renfrewshire in the 2010 census week was 1526 versus 1614 in the 2017 census [@RN499, supp.charts].

\section{Methods}\label{sec:renf-methods}

\subsection{Project approvals and timeline}\label{subsec:renf-methods-approvals}

The exploratory project utilised the controlled data service provided by UBDC and therefore required approval from UBDC's Research Approvals Committee (RAC). This process is more fully explained in section \ref{subsec:rac} Approval from RAC was gained on 01/06/2016. Ethical approval for the study was gained from the University of Glasgow College of Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee on 24/05/2016 (Appendix C).

Following academic and ethical approval the process of obtaining a data sharing agreement (DSA) between the University of Glasgow and Renfrewshire council was instigated. This involved the production of an agreement in principle and privacy impact assessment as a basis for the DSA. Production of the DSA involved the input of legal teams from both institutions as well as liaison with data analysts at Renfrewshire council and UBDC. The initial draft was produced by the local authority with amendments from both sides before final completion and signing 06/09/2017. Final transfer of data took place on 21/09/2017. An illustration of this timeline is shown in figure \ref{fig:ren-timeline}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Data}\label{subsec:renf-methods-data}

As with all services provided by Renfrewshire council, home care data is collected to ensure efficient management of the service and as evidence of service provision [@RN495]. Recording of individual episodes of care also helps with budgetary management of the service.

Data was provided in the format of one observation per individual per \emph{episode} of care. Each observation contained variables on: how many days per week and how many hours per day of home care an individual received for each type of care (e.g. mainstream or reablement etc. as described in table \ref{tab:renf-homecaredefs}). In addition, variables indicating the start and end dates of each episode as well as the service provider (e.g. local authority or independent provider) were present. Data was provided for all home care episodes in the Renfrewshire council area between April 2006 and April 2017. Demographic information detailing gender and year of birth was provided in a separate file. The provision of year of birth only meant age had to be calculated from the 1st of January in the provided year.


\subsection{Analysis}\label{subsec:renf-methods-analysis}

To enable analysis of the proportion of individuals captured by the census in each year, a time-series was created for the study period 27\textsuperscript{th} March 2006 to 28\textsuperscript{th} March 2016 at weekly intervals. The value of total hours of home care each individual was receiving for each type of service at each of the 523 weekly time points was identified. From this time series, weekly counts of the total number of individuals receiving home care were calculated. Additional tables counting the number of individuals receiving home care in quarter 4 of each financial year were also created. In order to validate the method used to count individuals, comparison was made between counts for each census week and the value indicated to be receiving home care in the SCS [@RN499]. 

As it was possible for individuals to receive home care of more than one type or experience gaps in provision of care in each financial year, individuals were grouped by those that had received any type of care during the census week and those that had none. This enabled comparison of the proportions of each age group, gender, as well as the type, amount, and duration of home care received between groups that were identified in the census or not.

\caption{Pseudo table exampler of calculation of total care received}
\label{tab:renf-pesudo-tab}
\end{table}

To report the proportion of all home care provided to individuals captured (or not) by the census, an aggregate value of total care provided was required. To facilitate this, a variable was created indicating the number of changes in care an individual received during each year (e.g. moving from 4hrs to 3hrs of care per week table \ref{tab:renf-pesudo-tab}). The total care per episode was calculated by multiplying the sum of weekly hours and number of meals received per week by the number of weeks each episode of care lasted within each financial year. From these values, it was then possible to calculate a total value for each individual in each financial year. Adding values for all individuals in each financial year gave a value for total home care delivered and perecentages of this value received by those captured during the SCS cenus week or quarter 4 of each year could then be calculated.

To the author's knowledge, no previous research or published statistics has created a measure indicating the comparitive value of one meal with hours of home care provided. The above method effectively assigns a value of 1hr of home care to each meal per week delivered. The outcome required for this analysis is to identify what proportion of care is delivered to those captured by census periods and it is therefore not necessary to identify a true comparitive figure for meals to hours of home care. 

Duration of care was calculated by the time elapsed from the beginning of each financial year to either the week where care was terminated or, for those with receiving care for over one year, to the end of the financial year. Average total weekly hours of care was calculated by summing the weekly hours of care of each care type received by an individual an calculating the mean value received over the course of the financial year. As the home care packages of the types "Community Mental Health", "Overnight Services", "Housing Support", and "Extra Care Housing" accounted for small percentages of care delivered, individuals receiving these types of care were omitted from comparative plots.

All data cleaning and analysis was conducted using the R language and environment for statistical computing version 3.5.1 [@RN295] with additional software packages: \texttt{dplyr} v0.7.8 [@RN283], \texttt{tidyr} v0.8.2. [@RN524], \texttt{forcats} v0.3.0 [@RN521], \texttt{purrr} v0.3.0 [@RN523], \texttt{lubridate} v1.7.4. [@RN522], \texttt{tibbletime} v0.1.1 [@RN356], \texttt{ggplot2} v3.1.0 [@RN525], and via the Integrated Development Environment RStudio v1.1.453 [@RN498]. Data was held securely in the safe haven environment described in section \ref{subsec:safe-haven}

\caption{Count of individuals receiving each type of home care service}
\label{tab:renf-types_hc}
\end{table}

Individuals could receive more than one type of care service within any financial year. Calculating the percentage of of all individuals receiving each type of service within each year reveals that the most utilised type of care was "Care at home (Mainstream)" services (table \ref{tab:renf-types_hc}). This accounted for the vast majority of all home care delivered during the study period, however the percentage of individuals receiving this service decreased over time (98% in 2006/07 to 72% in 2015/16). Meals and Reablement are the next most utilised services. Reablement was very rarely utilised before 2011/12 but then quickly became more heavily used with approximately one-third of individuals receiving this service between 2012/13 and 2015/16. Other services are much less utilised with very low percetnages of individuals receiving them.  


\subsection{Counts of individuals receiving home care}\label{subsec:renf-res-counts}

Approximately 60% of all individuals receiving home care in each financial year also received care during the census week. This indicates they would have observations returned to the SCS (figure \ref{fig:ren-hc-counts}). The percentage receiving care during the census week decreases over time from over 62% in 2006/07 to 57.3% in 2015/16 (table \ref{tab:ren-hc-counts})

Figure \ref{fig:ren-hc-counts} also shows that were the census period extended to include all those receiving home care during the last quarter of each financial year, approximately 70% of all individuals receiving care across the whole year would be returned in the SCS. Again the percentage decreases over time from 72% in 2006/07 to 68.8% in 2015/16 (table \ref{tab:ren-hc-counts}). 

Finally, figure \ref{fig:ren-hc-counts} and table \ref{tab:ren-hc-counts} show the difference between counts of individuals receiving care in each census week produced by this analysis and the value shown in the SCS. There is some variation with slight over and under counts in different years. The largest difference is an over count of 103 individuals in 2012/13 and the smallest an undercount of 5 individuals in 2006/07.

Whilst the percentage of individuals captured by the census varied from 57% to 62%, the share of all home care provided these individuals received (calculated by the sum of total hours of home care per week and number of meals per week multiplied by the number of weeks of care) varied from 71% to 78% (figure \ref{fig:renf-totalcare}). This value peaked in 2009/10 and has gradually reduced since then.

The percentage of males and females aged 65-69 not captured by the census is below the overall figure of 42.7% in 2015/16 whilst there is a higher proportion of males in age groups over 80 (similar patterns are seen across all years). It follows that the opposite is true for the group captured by the census where higher percentages of 65-69 year old males and females and lower percentages of males in older age groups than the 57.3% overall figure are seen. Apart from these differences, the distribution of receipt of care follows the overall pattern.

\subsubsection{By type of care}

The introduction and increasing usage of reablement services over time shown in table \ref{tab:renf-types_hc} can be seen clearly in figure \ref{fig:ren-types}. Higher than average percentages of those receiving Reablement and Rapid Response services are \emph{not} captured by the census. Conversely, below average percentages of those receiving Mainstream and Meals services receive care during periods not including the census week. The lower panel of figure \ref{fig:ren-types} shows the opposite picture.

\subsubsection{By duration of care}

\end{figure}

The median duration of home care for within each financial year for individuals whose care overlaps with the census week is considerably higher than for those whose care does not (figure \ref{fig:ren-duration-1}). The distribution of duration of care is tight around 52 weeks for those captured by the census. Those not captured have a wider, even distibution of care duration. These patterns remain when broken down by care type (figure \ref{fig:ren-duration-2}).

\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:ren-hrs-1} plots the distribution of mean total weekly hours of home care received by individuals in each financial year. With the exception of 2009/10 and 2010/11, the median value of mean total weekly hours of home care received is lower for the group who received care that overlapped the census week. The difference between median values in each group is higher from 2011/12 onwards. This coincides with the increase in usage of Reablement services (figure \ref{fig:ren-hrs-2}). From 2012/13 onwards the distribution of weekly hours of care for Reablement services is so tight that no box or whiskers are visible in the plot which instead shows a line at 7 hours in both groups. Comparison of the distribution of mean weekly hours shows similar values within care types across both groups (captured or missed by the census).

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:renf-discuss}

\subsection{Findings}\label{subsec:renf-discuss-find}

In the Renfrewshire council area, approximately 60% of individuals who receive home care are likely to be captured in the SCS. Since 2010/11 (the year when individual-level data was first collected by the SCS) these individuals receive between 70% & 75% of all home care delivered during the entire financial year. If a census quarter, rather than a census week, had been used as the data collection period, then over 70% of individuals, receiving approximately 85% of all home care delivered, would have been captured.  There are no major differences in the age and gender of those captured in the census although there is some variation at higher and lower age ranges. Individuals receiving Mainstream and Meals services are more likely to be captured in the cenus than those receiving Reablement or Rapid Response services. The nature of these latter services contributes to the fact that those missed by the census are much more likely to receive care over a shorter number of weeks albeit with higher intensity care provision (measured by average weekly hours of care received). 

Identification of the percentage of individuals receiving care during the SCS census week and, more importantly, the share of all social care provision they receive indicates the only best-estimate of SCS coverage to date. Knowledge that individuals receiving home care who are captured in the census receive up to three-quarters of all provision suggests this section of the SCS already has good coverage. This is likely to imporove with proposed new data collection periods which could capture individuals receiving in excess of four-fifths of all care delivered. 
The data made available by Renfrewshire council did not indicate where services had stopped due to mortality. Therefore, the figures suggested for the propotion of home care users captured by the SCS are likely to be an underestimate where analyses model social care data from the SCS and omit individuals who died (such as those found in chapter \ref{ch:res2}). 

Whilst quantifying the percentage of home care users and the share of care they receive is useful, interpretation of the coverage of the most recent years of the SCS (from 2014/15 onwards) must also consider the fact that individuals receiving telecare or community alarm services at any time in the financial year are included. It is possible that individuals who receive one of these services may also have home care during the financial year but not at a time that coincides with the census date. This could result in an overestimate of the proportion of individuals missed by the census in this analysis. Given those with home care outwith the census week are more likely to receive short bursts of care, the magnitude of this potential error is likely to be small, though difficult to quantify. 

For those \emph{not} captured in the census, there are even distributions of duration of care across all types. Given their temporary nature, this would be expected for Reablement and Rapid Response services. The fact that the distribution is even for those receiving Mainstream or Meals services (which generally last more than a year) indicates a random aspect as to when the service comes to an end supporting the hypothesis that death may be a cause of cessation of care. 

Those that \emph{are} captured in the census tend to have been receiving care for a longer period. Interestingly, those captured by the census and receiving Reablement or Rapid Response services also had longer overall durations of care compared to those not in the census. Both Reablement and Rapid Response services are intended as short, stop-gap interventions but it is possible some individuals go on to require longer-term care and end up being re-classified as receiving Mainstream services. This may explain the slightly wider distribution of duration for individuals captured by the census receiving these services compared to Mainstream or Meals services.  

Reablement and Rapid Response services are delivered with greater intensity as measured by average total weekly hours of care received. The lack of variation in this value for Reablement services seen in figure \ref{fig:ren-hrs-2} indicates almost all individuals receiving this service do so for seven hours a week (most likely as one-hour-per-day). There are no major differences between the distributions of mean weekly hours within care types.

Considering all similarities and differences between groups of individuals captured and not captured in the census a picture emerges indicating that those missed by the census have either ceased to receive care altogether (most likely due to death), or were in receipt of short, intense forms of home care such as Reablement or Rapid Response services. The census is likely to catch individuals in receipt of Mainstream or Meals services who have been receiving them for longer terms and also those receiving short forms of care that happen to overlap the census week.


\subsection{Limitations}\label{subsec:renf-discuss-lim}

This analysis is limited by the fact that data was obtained from only one local authority area. Whether the number of individuals captured or not by the SCS in the Renfrewshire area is indicative of numbers across the country is unknown. Given each of the 32 local authorities in Scotland have bespoke methods of delivering and recording social care the findings from this analysis can not be immediately generalised to a national level. The findings do, however, give the only indication yet attempted of how representative the SCS is. 

Furthermore, the method of summarising data into packages of care is subjective and may differ from the method used by Renfrewshire council to complete the SCS. Absolute numbers of individuals receiving home care in each financial year in this analysis are similar to those returned by Renfrewshire council to the SCS overall with some mild discrepancies. Eligibility to be included in the home care census has changed over the years (e.g. "Housing Support" and "Overnight Services" being included as home care and then collected as a separate type of service in later years) and the collection of individual-level data did not begin until 2010/11. Whether this has changed how data is collated at the local level for return to SCS is unknown but may explain differences in counts. 

\subsection{Implications}\label{subsec:renf-discuss-imp}

The findings from this analysis provide the only estimation to date of the proportion of home care users identified by the SCS in any given financial year. Caution is required when generalising these findings to the whole of Scotland. However, the findings suggest a plausible figure to aid interpretation of administrative data linkage research conducted with the SCS (such as described in other chapters of this thesis). Inclusion of all home care users receiving services over quarter 4 in the 2017/18 census should increase the percentage of users captured by approximately 10% to roughly 70% and coverage of all care delivered from pproximately 70%-75% to approximately 80%-85%. 

The analysis of the data from Renfrewshire council has shown there are different patterns in the duration and intensity of home care packages according to the type of care being provided (e.g. between "Care at home (Mainstream)" and "Rapid Response" type packages). The SCS does not collect data on the categorisation of care type - apart from a single flag identifying Reablement services in more recent collections. Therefore the differences in services cannot be accounted for in research using the SCS. Adding a standardised classification of home care type to the SCS would allow a richer interpretation of home care users for both official statistical reporting and research purposes. 

\subsection{Future work}\label{subsec:renf-discuss-future}

Future work using this data should consider the difference in individuals receiving care at different time intervals (e.g. first six months of the financial year). If the census week were to capture a higher proportion of individuals in a more narrow time-frame then alternative types of statistical analyses, such as time-to-event (survival) analysis, may be possible using SCS data.

The data from Renfrewshire council also offers the opportunity to longitudinally analyse home care use by age, gender, and type of home care groups.  Quantifying any differences in the change over time in the amount of home care used would be of interest to both researchers and local authority providers. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:renf-conc}

Analysis of individual level social care data from Renfrewshire council area suggests that the number of people recorded as receiving home care by the Social Care Survey captures approximately 60% of the total number of people that will receive home care during a financial year. These individuals receive 70%-75% of all social care provision in any year. Those not captured during a census week are likely to be individuals who died or received short-term care only. Collection of additional data in the SCS, such as start and stop dates for all packages of care and type of home care delivered, would improve the inferences that can be made from the SCS currently.
