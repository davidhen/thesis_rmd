\section{Main outomes}\label{sec:disc-main-points}

* The aim of this thesis was 1, 2, 3.  

\section{Findings}
Go through all results and discuss
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Descriptives
\item SC models - Big section. Combine discussion of both models >96% and 92-96%
\begin{itemize}
\item APEs show effects *after* adjusting for other variables (and interactions)
\item Age by far the biggest effect  
\item Female effect fairly small after adjustment for age and MM (compared to descriptives)
\item Magnitude of effects important. (Note SIMD * 10 = similar effect of going from 65-69 to 75-79 i.e. being deprived ages you by 10 years)
\item Variation in APE for LAs could be a few things e.g. budget cuts, data, random
\item Tight CIs likely reflect large sample size (wider CI for age > 95 small numbers)
\item Bump in APE values for older age groups and high meds related to increase in comm alarm observations from 2014/15 onwards. *note very small effect changes**
\item Fluctuating APEs for councils to do with baseline level of reference council also fluctuating. Again - *very small changes in APE*
\end{itemize}
\item USC models - Big section
\begin{itemize}
\item Point 1
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Limitations}
* This was limited by a, b, c (Need to talk about measures chosen, especially the meds MM measure and how I counted meds, here. Also need to discuss lack of PC data as a major limitation with respect to MM)   

\section{Comparisons to previous research}
* Compare to past research

\section{Implications}
\subsection{LA Variation}
* Implications are d, e, f - discuss in light of pro-rich/pro-poor framework
* Street-level beurocracy? I doubt it. More likely differing knowlege/skills - failure to learn from other areas
* Inverse Care Law - no evidence with this research - !But not adjusted - future research

\subsection{Social Care data}\label{sec:disc-sc-data}

Discuss quality and collection of SCS (place this nationally/internationally) 
Is there good sc data anywhere???

What is good/bad - What have I learned?

\subsection{Administrative Data Research}\label{sec:disc-admin-data}

Difficulties encountered

* Timeframe!!
* Safe Haven (software upgrade etc.)
* Benefits

\section{Future research}
* Future research should g, h, i (1. Link to census. 2.Measure *longitudinal* changes in social care and impact on usc. 3. Break down SCS and USC variables - any difference in home care patterns? What about Admissions and A & E only? 4. Look at e.g. those with over 9 meds and *didn't* get social care/usc. What's the craic with them?)
