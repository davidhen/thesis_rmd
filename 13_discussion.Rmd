\section{Main outomes}\label{sec:disc-main-points}

* The aim of this thesis was 1, 2, 3.  

\section{Findings}
Go through all results and discuss
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Renfrewshire
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Brief overview of discussion from chapter
\item Also discuss implicit finding that finite number of places for social care in Renfrew. Allocation according to \emph{resource} not \emph{need}. 
\end{itemize}
\item Descriptives
\item SC models - Big section. Combine discussion of both models >96% and 92-96%
\begin{itemize}
\item APEs show effects *after* adjusting for other variables (and interactions)
\item Big differences in overall numbers *and* percentages between models (>96 \& 92-95.9). >96 has smaller numbers for very old and much higher percentage (\~70%) receiving care compared to national average (\~45%). 
\item Second group of models include both largest cities...
\item Age by far the biggest effect  
\item Female effect fairly small after adjustment for age and MM (compared to descriptives) - Does this warrant splitting by sex before modelling?
\item Magnitude of effects important. (Note SIMD * 10 = similar effect of going from 65-69 to 75-79 i.e. being deprived ages you by 10 years)
\item Variation in APE for LAs could be a few things e.g. budget cuts, data, random
\item Bump in APE values for older age groups and high meds related to increase in comm alarm observations from 2014/15 onwards. *note very small effect changes**
\item Fluctuating APEs for councils to do with baseline level of reference council also fluctuating. Again - *very small changes in APE*
\end{itemize}
\item USC models - Big section
\begin{itemize}
\item Overall smaller magnitude of effects *except* for the deaders. 
\item Effects magnitude lower for admission and A \& E compared to any USC
\item Care home positive effect for any USC but *negative* effect for admission and A \& E
\item Overall poorer fitting models.
\item Fluctuation in APEs at older ages across models likely reflects smaller numbers *but* compare to SC models...
\end{itemize}
\item Overall findings
\begin{itemize}
\item Tight CIs likely reflect large sample size (wider CI for age > 95 small numbers)
\item Difference in $R^2$ for USC likely due to fact SC models are subsets of data rather than whole cohort.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Limitations}
* This was limited by a, b, c (Need to talk about measures chosen, especially the meds MM measure and how I counted meds, here. Also need to discuss lack of PC data as a major limitation with respect to MM)  
* Social care data - Levels home care steady for me but decreasing in SCS - why is linkage rate steady?
* No measure for living alone

\section{Comparisons to previous research}
* Compare to past research

\section{Implications}
\subsection{LA Variation}
* Implications are d, e, f - discuss in light of pro-rich/pro-poor framework
* Street-level beurocracy? I doubt it. More likely differing knowlege/skills - failure to learn from other areas
* Inverse Care Law - no evidence with this research - !But not adjusted - future research
* As above - allocation according to resource not need in Renfrew

\subsection{Social Care data}\label{sec:disc-sc-data}

Discuss quality and collection of SCS (place this nationally/internationally) 
Is there good sc data anywhere???

What is good/bad - What have I learned?

\subsection{Administrative Data Research}\label{sec:disc-admin-data}

Difficulties encountered

* Timeframe!!
* Safe Haven (software upgrade etc.)
* Benefits

\section{Future research}
* Future research should:- 
* Link to census  
* Measure *longitudinal* changes in social care and impact on usc  
* Break down SCS and USC variables - any difference in home care patterns? What about Admissions and A & E only?  
* Look at e.g. those with over 9 meds and *didn't* get social care/usc. What's the craic with them?)
