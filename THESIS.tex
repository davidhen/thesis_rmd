\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}

\thispagestyle{empty}

\textbf{Background:} Multimorbidity, the presence of two or more
long-term health conditions, is increasing in prevalence worldwide. This
is due to increasing life expectancy although 30\% of those aged 45-65
are also affected. Multimorbidity is associated with a number of
negative outcomes including increased mortality, lower quality-of-life,
and lower functional status. Unsurprisingly, it is also associated with
greater use of health services. Little is known, however, about whether
people with multimorbidity also receive more social care. The aim of the
research was to assess the relationship between multimorbidity and
social care, and the association of multimorbidity and social care on
unplanned admission to hospital.

\textbf{Methods:} A retrospective population-based observational study
using linked administrative health and social care records was
conducted. All individuals over the age of 65 with a valid Community
Health Index (CHI) number in Scotland during the financial years 2011/12
to 2015/16 were included. A proxy measurement of multimorbidity derived
from prescribing data was used. Logistic regression models reporting
Average Partial Effects (APEs) were employed to investigate associations
between outcome and explanatory variables. Use of social care was
assessed using the Scottish Social Care Survey (SCS). In order to assess
its validity, all social care data from one local authority was obtained
and analysed to assess the proportion of home care users likely to be
captured by the SCS.

\textbf{Results:} Over 1.1 million people were included in the cohort.
73\% of participants were prescribed more than two repeat medicines.
Multimorbidity was associated with receipt of social care. After
adjustment for other variables, a 15\% increased probability of
receiving social care was observed for those in the highest
multimorbidity group (receiving 9+ repeat medicines) compared to the
lowest group (receiving 0-2 repeat medicines). Both multimorbidity and
receipt of social care were associated with unplanned hospital admission
after adjustment (9\% increased probability of unplanned admission in
the highest multimorbidity group, 7\% increased probability for those
that received social care). The SCS captured 60\% of home care users
representing up to 75\% of all home care delivered in addition to all
individuals receiving community alarm and telecare services.

\textbf{Conclusion:} This is one of the first studies to link health and
social care data on a national scale. It showed an association between
multimorbidity and use of social care. This finding is novel and
indicates wider societal implications due to the increased prevalence of
multimorbidity than has previously been described. Receipt of social
care was also associated with increasing age, female sex, and lower
socioeconomic position. Both multimorbidity and receipt of social care
were associated with unplanned hospital admission. These findings have
implications for policymakers interested in health and social care
integration and the expected benefits of such reorganisation.

\thispagestyle{empty}

I am indebted to my PhD supervisors, Professors Nick Bailey, Colin
McCowan, and Stewart Mercer for their continued support and
encouragement throughout the long, and occasionally tortuous, process of
completing this thesis. It has really been a pleasure learning from, and
working with, such esteemed colleagues.

I would also like to thank Dr Iain Atherton, for making me aware of this
PhD opportunity in the first place and also for his support and
encouragement throughout the process.

Administrative data research is reliant on many organisations and the
individuals who work for them, sometimes without any contact with the
research team at all. I am aware there will be many people whom I have
never met, nor heard of, who had a part in enabling this project to
happen - a thanks to all these individuals at: The Urban Big Data
Centre, eDRIS, NHS National Services Scotland, ADRC-S, National Records
of Scotland, the Scottish Government, and the University of Glasgow.

Of course, there are individuals who play a very important part and had
a very \emph{hands-on} relationship with the project. I would like pay
particular tribute to Dr Mirjam Allik (previously of UBDC) and Amy
Tilbrook (eDRIS/UBDC/ADRC-S and now Scottish Government).

Mirjam's guidance made the successful navigation of the complex
approvals process required for research of this nature possible. Amy's
work in co-ordinating the data linkage process, despite many setbacks,
went a long way to ensuring this project did not fail. Furthermore,
through the statistical disclosure control process of my (many!)
research outputs, Amy proved to be the first sanity check on the
analyses - thanks for catching my mistakes! People that understand the
nuts and bolts of data linkage projects (and the realities of what can
and cannot be achieved) are the unsung heroes of this branch of research
- so once again a special thank you to you both.

This is one of the first projects to utilise the Social Care Survey in a
research context. This would not have been possible without the help and
support of Julie Rintoul and Ellen Lynch at the Health and Social Care
analysis division at the Scottish Government. It was with dismay I
learned of Julie's untimely death in June 2019. Her work with social
care data over almost 20 years has laid the foundations for many
exciting research opportunities now being realised.

I would also like to thank Dave Clark who undertook the indexing of the
Social Care Survey to the NRS population spine - without this piece of
work the thesis would look very different indeed!

One of the pleasures of the PhD process has been learning to code using
open source software R via RStudio. Worldwide, academics and developers
spend countless hours adding and improving the tens of thousands of
packages of software available for use with R. In the best cases
detailed documentation or vignettes are also supplied making the
learning process markedly easier. This work is then shared for all to
use - free of charge. The list of individuals who contributed their own
time to develop the many packages I have used for the analysis and
reporting of this PhD likely runs to hundreds, if not thousands. For
this I'd like to thank the R community, without whose tools I would
never have managed to complete the complex data manipulation required
for the project.

Formal processes have, however, also helped me on the road to academia.
I was fortunate to earn an Early Career Clinical Fellowship offered by
NHS Education for Scotland in 2012. This fellowship paid for my Masters
education, granted me backfill time-off from my busy job as a nurse, and
supported me to grow personally and professionally. To say the
fellowship (and the MRes course at the University of Stirling it enabled
me to complete) had life-changing effects would be an understatement.
I'd therefore like to say thank-you to Ann Rae and all at ECCF for their
support in setting me on a different road.

Completing this PhD from home in the Highlands would not have been
possible without the generosity and hospitality of Mrs Lena Ramage for
my trips to Glasgow - Tapadh leibh a'bhrònag.

Finally, I would like to thank my children, Seumas and Catherine (for
tolerating a grumpy Dad, particularly over the final few months), and
especially my wife, Shona. It has been a long time since I first said
that I thought I might like to go to University. Life has been a
roller-coaster since then and I would certainly have fallen off the
tracks without you Shona. Tha gaol agam ort.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}
\thispagestyle{empty}

\section{Context}\label{sec:intro-context}

Worldwide demographic changes have seen increases in life expectancy and
the proportion of the population over the age of 60 grow, partly due to
better health programmes and treatments (Beard \emph{et al.}, 2016; AMS,
2018). Accompanying this growth is an increase in the prevalence of
multimorbidity - the presence of two or more chronic health conditions
in one individual (Guthrie \emph{et al.}, 2011; Mercer \emph{et al.},
2014; Beard \emph{et al.}, 2016; NICE, 2016; AMS, 2018; The-Lancet,
2018). These changes are seen across the world in both high-income and
low-to-middle-income countries where non-communicable diseases have
replaced communicable diseases as the major burden of healthcare and
contribute to two-thirds of all deaths (Imison, 2012; WHO, 2014; Beard
\emph{et al.}, 2016; AMS, 2018). The increasing prevalence of
multimorbidity has profound impacts for clinicians, policy-makers and
research.

There is some evidence suggesting that multimorbidity disproportionately
affects women and those of lower socioeconomic position (Barnett
\emph{et al.}, 2012; Violan \emph{et al.}, 2014; AMS, 2018). Those in
the latter group are more likely to have a mix of physical and mental
health conditions, which develop 10-15 years earlier than seen in their
more affluent peers, and are thus more likely to have complex care needs
(Mercer \emph{et al.}, 2009; Barnett \emph{et al.}, 2012). The
association between multimorbidity and increasing age is well documented
(Guthrie \emph{et al.}, 2011; AMS, 2018). However, a large proportion of
younger, working age adults also have multiple chronic conditions
(Taylor \emph{et al.}, 2010; Moffat and Mercer, 2015). In one landmark
study, the absolute number of people with multimorbidity under the age
of 65 was higher than for those over 65 (Barnett \emph{et al.}, 2012).
Given these demographic changes, and the implications of fiscal
austerity on health outcomes (Karanikolos \emph{et al.}, 2013),
governments in high-income countries are having to identify ways of
financing increasing demand for public services (Anderson, 2011).

As a result, many countries have recently seen policies implemented that
aim to integrate the provision of health and social care services
(Stewart \emph{et al.}, 2003; Burgess, 2012; Glasby, 2017). In addition
to reducing variations in the provision of care across geographic areas,
these policies hope to save public money by reducing unplanned
admissions and delayed discharges from hospital, whilst also improving
the quality of services for individuals (OECD/EU, 2013; Burgess, 2016;
Scottish-Government, 2016b). There is, however, little evidence showing
the efficacy of these policies on desired outcomes (Stewart \emph{et
al.}, 2003; Petch, 2009; Weatherly \emph{et al.}, 2010; A Petch, 2012;
Burgess, 2012; Robson, 2013; Damery \emph{et al.}, 2016; Kaehne \emph{et
al.}, 2017). Nevertheless, the continued drive to integrate services
implicitly acknowledges that health and social care are services with a
link.

Similarly, whilst much previous (and suggested) research on
multimorbidity is aimed at understanding its effect on health care
services (AMS, 2018), a gap in knowledge describing its relationship
with social care exists. In Scotland, approximately two-thirds of
individuals receiving social care are over the age of 65
(Scottish-Government, 2016d) whilst approximately two-thirds of all
those over the age of 65 have multimorbidity (Barnett \emph{et al.},
2012). It would seem intuitive that a large proportion of those
receiving social care have multimorbidity. However, no single data
source exists that allows this comparison to be made. This reflects the
paucity of good social care data seen internationally (OECD/EU, 2013).

All this comes against a backdrop of reductions in the number of people
receiving formal social care services since 2010 in both England and
Scotland as a result of financial austerity measures (Macleod and Mair,
2015; Burchardt \emph{et al.}, 2015; Scottish-Government, 2017e). Until
recently many local authorities had attempted to protect front-line
services, such as social care, from austerity cuts (Hastings \emph{et
al.}, 2015). However, given continued year-on-year reductions and
further cuts to local authority spending (e.g.~in Scotland a further
7.2\% in 2016/2017 (Audit-Scotland, 2016b)), the ability to protect
social care from reductions in spend becomes less likely. These
decreases in local government budgets across the UK have affected those
living in the poorest areas hardest (Hastings \emph{et al.}, 2015;
Gannon \emph{et al.}, 2017) which poses questions of equitable access to
services (Oliver, 2018b).

These questions are valid given the presence of the inverse care law in
UK primary care settings where, ``The availability of good medical care
tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served.
This inverse care law operates more completely where medical care is
most exposed to market forces, and less so where exposure is reduced.''
(Tudor-Hart, 1971). This is demonstrated by higher ratios of General
Practitioners to population in England's most affluent neighbourhoods
(CfWI, 2014; Stafford \emph{et al.}, 2018) and inequitable resource
allocation in Scotland (Mercer and Watt, 2007; McLean \emph{et al.},
2015). Given the unequal distribution of cuts to services discussed
above, presence of an inverse social care law is possible.

There are, therefore, numerous areas where deeper understanding of the
relationships between health and social care would be beneficial. This
PhD research was commissioned by the Scottish Government, via the
Economic \& Social Research Council (ESRC), with the explicit aim of
doing this via administrative data linkage using Scottish resources.
Research of this type is ideally suited for investigating cross-sectoral
relationships and is being increasingly used in the social sciences
(Atherton \emph{et al.}, 2015). Linking data from NHS and local
authority social care sources has proved problematic in the past (Witham
\emph{et al.}, 2015), although new sources of data may provide the
potential to overcome these barriers.

\section{Aims}\label{sec:intro-aims-obs}

The thesis has three aims as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Identify the best source of social care data in Scotland that can be linked to health data at an individual level (ideally in a national context) and assess its suitability for research
\item Create a linked dataset that can be used to answer questions relevant to multimorbidity and the provision of health and social care services 
\item Demonstrate the ability of this dataset to answer pertinent cross-sectoral questions by undertaking analysis to explore the associations between multimorbidity, social care, and unplanned hospital admission.
\end{enumerate}

Given past difficulties in linking health and social care data (Witham
\emph{et al.}, 2015), the first aim of the research involved liaison
with relevant stakeholders in local and national government as well as
appraisal of any relevant on-line materials and is discussed fully in
section \ref{subsec-litrv-linkage-sources}.

After identification of data that \emph{could} be linked, the next aim
was to realise this linkage. This process first required appraisal of
the ability to accurately measure multimorbidity and social care with
the identified sources. Furthermore, as described in Section
\ref{sec:linkage}, probabilistic matching of the SCS to CHI records was
required to enable linkage. This work was commissioned by the Scottish
Government and carried out by an analyst at the National Records of
Scotland.

In order to be granted information governance approval to link these
sources of data together, and also to achieve aim number 3, relevant
research questions had to be formulated. Based on the literature
reviewed in chapter \ref{ch:lit-review}, the following questions were
derived:

\section{Research questions}\label{sec:rqs}

In people over the age of 65 in Scotland:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item What are the socioeconomic, demographic, and multimorbidity patterns in the use of social care? 
\item Is there an association between receipt of social care and multimorbidity status. Does this vary by the patterns described in 1(a)?  
\end{enumerate}
\item Is there an association between unplanned hospital admission, multimorbidity, and the receipt of social care?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Thesis structure}\label{sec:lit-review-structure}

There are eight chapters, including this introduction, in the thesis.

Chapter \ref{ch:lit-review} reviews literature relating to the main
themes of the thesis: multimorbidity, social care, health and social
care, and administrative data linkage. As much of the work of the
project is exploratory in nature, a systematic review of literature was
not appropriate. Instead, each section of the chapter provides a
contextual review of literature relevant to its topic from academic and
policy sources.

Chapter \ref{ch:data} details methods employed for the main project
analysis. Firstly, a description of the information governance
procedures that were required in order to access the sensitive data used
in analyses is provided. This is followed by a detailed description of
the administrative data sources used. The third section briefly
describes the indexing of the social care survey to the National Records
of Scotland (NRS) population spine which enabled linked of social care
data to CHI databases. Following this, a section detailing the extensive
data cleaning and manipulation process applied to the numerous raw data
files to enable analysis is provided. The fifth section discusses the
statistical methods applied in order to answer the stated research
questions. The final section provides a timeline of the PhD project and
briefly discusses important temporal milestones.

Chapter \ref{ch:renfrew} is a stand-alone chapter. The literature review
and liaison with relevant stakeholders identified that the Social Care
Survey (SCS) would be the best source of data to link to health records
at a national level. However, some variables of the survey only collect
information of individuals during a census week. This chapter attempts
to quantify what proportion of the total number of people receiving home
care in any given financial year are captured by the SCS. This was done
by completing a data-sharing agreement with one local authority area and
obtaining all social care records from a ten-year period. Comparison is
made between individuals who received care in the census week with those
who did not.

Chapter \ref{ch:results-1} provides detailed descriptive statistics of
the large, linked health and social care cohort in five sections: the
characteristics of the cohort by age, sex, and geography, the
distribution of repeat prescribed medicines, the distribution of
deprivation, the distribution of receipt of social care, and the
distribution of unplanned admission to hospital.

Chapter \ref{ch:res2} provides results of statistical models relevant to
the two research questions. As described in Chapter \ref{ch:data},
linkage rates of the SCS to the CHI register varied at the local
authority level. This made comparison across council areas more
difficult. In order to overcome this, two groups of data including local
authorities with similar match rates were created in models relevant to
research question 1. Both research questions are answered via logistic
regression models reporting Average Partial Effects (APEs).

Chapter \ref{ch:discussion} discusses the key findings of the research
in context, compares findings with previous research, addresses the
numerous strengths and weaknesses of the project, and makes
recommendations for future research.

Finally, Chapter \ref{ch:conclusion} provides a brief conclusion to the
thesis as a whole.

\chapter{Literature Review}\label{ch:lit-review}
\thispagestyle{empty}

The aims of the thesis are exploratory in nature and as such, no
specific question is defined for the literature review. Instead, the aim
is to scope literature relevant to the main themes outlined in the
introduction and identify where links can be made across separate
fields. This chapter summarises academic and policy literature relevant
to the main thesis themes regarding a) multimorbidity, b) social care,
c) the interaction of health and social care services, and d)
administrative data linkage. As the main research is conducted with
Scottish data, there was a focus on the structures and policies
regarding health and social care in this country. However, this is
placed in the wider context of the UK and high-income countries.

The chapter is organised in four parts following the main themes listed
above. Section \ref{sec:mm} describes why multimorbidity is important in
the context of health and social care services and then provides an
overview of academic literature and policy documents regarding
multimorbidity and its definitions, measurement, and impact on health
inequalities.

Section \ref{sec:access-sc} focuses on social care from a number of
perspectives: varying definitions of the term, differing international
models of care delivery, how eligibility for social care is determined
in the UK, how resources are allocated in Scotland, and finally selected
social theories of eligibility and resource allocation.

Section \ref{sec:hsc-interaction} outlines the policy framework
regarding health and social care services and the historical policy
context of service integration. It then describes the legislation that
made health and social care integration law in Scotland before reviewing
empirical evidence of the nature of the interaction between health and
social care services.

The final, short section provides an overview of literature on the
emerging research paradigm of administrative data linkage. The section
discusses what linkage involves, its benefits and drawbacks, and
outlines the data sources selected for this project with a justification
for their inclusion.

Given the nature of this review, the search strategy for literature
employed varying methods. The first section on multimorbidity leant
itself to traditional bibliographic database searches (Medline, Web of
Science, Google Scholar) for key terms: ``multimorbidity'' and
``comorbidity'' in relation to the subsection headings: ``definitions'',
``measurement'', and ``health inequalities''. As an overview of the
whole topic and subsections was desired, initial searches were limited
to include only systematic reviews and, where necessary, pertinent
references from citation lists were retrieved and included. ``Grey''
literature was also searched for using websites of prominent think-tanks
(e.g.~the King's Fund), and research groups (e.g.~the International
Research Community of Multimorbidity).

Literature on social care was mostly found from ``grey'' sources such as
the King's Fund and Nuffield Trust, with a ``snowball'' method from
reference lists employed to identify further relevant reading. In
addition, the Social Care Institute for Excellence's resources list was
also investigated for pertinent literature. As much of the focus of this
section related to policy aspects, relevant publications from UK and
Scottish Governments were sought.

Health and social care interaction and integration have recently been
topics of high policy interest and have been extensively covered by
think-tanks. As a result, much literature in this section is informed by
reports from these sources and the references contained within them.
Section \ref{subsec:research} included database searches for studies
specifically investigating interactions in health and social care. Very
few empirical studies in this area exist, although one recent systematic
review helped guide further literature searches. One included reference
(Porter, no date), is an unpublished report requested directly from the
authors.

Background information on administrative data linkage was informed by
reports produced by the Administrative Data Research Network (ADRN) and
references contained within.

Initial searches of literature were conducted in Spring 2016 with
continual updates. A formal update of all aspects was completed in May
2019. The review provides a detailed summary after each section with a
synthesis of all sections contained in the chapter conclusion.

\section{Multimorbidity}\label{sec:mm}

This section reviews relevant literature regarding multimorbidity.
Firstly, an overview of the main themes found in the literature is
provided before more in-depth reviews of three main themes arising from
this: concepts and definitions of multimorbidity, measures of
multimorbidity, and finally multimorbidity with regard to health
inequalities.

\subsection{Context}\label{subsec:litrv-mm-context}

At first sight, the definition of multimorbidity as the presence of two
or more health conditions in one individual appears clear and concise.
In fact, there are many competing concepts and definitions of
multimorbidity in research literature resulting in confusing messages
regarding epidemiology, measurement, and treatment (Guthrie \emph{et
al.}, 2011; Almirall and Fortin, 2013; EGPRN, 2013; Lefevre \emph{et
al.}, 2014; AMS, 2018). One systematic review found the prevalence of
multimorbidity in the general population to vary between 13.1\% - 71.8\%
in studies where different definitions had been employed (Fortin
\emph{et al.}, 2012). Another, concentrating on primary care
populations, reported variation of prevalence between 12.9\% and 95.1\%
(Violan \emph{et al.}, 2014).

Despite this, it is generally accepted that multimorbidity is the norm
for individuals with at least one chronic condition (Guthrie \emph{et
al.}, 2011) in both high-income and low-to-middle-income countries
(Afshar \emph{et al.}, 2015) and is increasing in prevalence (AMS, 2018;
Lyons \emph{et al.}, 2018). It disproportionately affects those of
lowest socioeconomic position (Guthrie \emph{et al.}, 2011; AMS, 2018;
Stafford \emph{et al.}, 2018) who can develop multimorbidity up to 10 to
15 years earlier than their most affluent counterparts and are more
likely to have a mix of physical and mental health conditions (Barnett
\emph{et al.}, 2012; Stafford \emph{et al.}, 2018). Females are also
disproportionately affected although evidence suggests this association
can vary across countries (AMS, 2018).

There is also a consensus that multimorbidity is associated with a
number of negative outcomes including: higher mortality (Gijsen \emph{et
al.}, 2001; Guthrie \emph{et al.}, 2011; Jani \emph{et al.}, 2019),
reduced quality-of-life (Fortin \emph{et al.}, 2004, 2005; Guthrie
\emph{et al.}, 2011), reduced functional status (Kadam and Croft, 2007;
Guthrie \emph{et al.}, 2011), and increased psychological distress
(Fortin \emph{et al.}, 2006). All of these are likely contributors to
the association of multimorbidity with increased use of healthcare
services (Gijsen \emph{et al.}, 2001; Salisbury \emph{et al.}, 2011;
Guthrie \emph{et al.}, 2011; Lyons \emph{et al.}, 2018).

This raises a particular challenge to those responsible for delivering
healthcare which has been traditionally structured around treating
single diseases. This is partly due to the fact that many clinical
guidelines are based on the results of Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs)
investigating the efficacy of a single treatment on a single disease
(Moffat and Mercer, 2015; WHO, 2016a; Watt, 2017; AMS, 2018; Oliver,
2018a). The fact that those with multimorbidity are routinely excluded
from such trials means the effectiveness of treatments (and presence of
adverse events) in ``the real world'' are often unquantified (Moffat and
Mercer, 2015; WHO, 2016a; Watt, 2017; AMS, 2018; Oliver, 2018a). The
increased use of services also has financial implications for societies
grappling with constraints imposed by austerity measures (Allen, 2018).

One potential solution to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery
is to focus resources in community and primary care services rather than
expensive secondary care (WHO, 2015; Stafford \emph{et al.}, 2018).
Here, care can be focussed in a more holistic sense by identifying goals
and targets in partnership with the individual themselves (WHO, 2016b;
Watt, 2017; Mair and Gallacher, 2017). Services provided by healthcare
professionals with generalist rather than specialist skills (such as
multi-disciplinary teams in primary care), are best placed to deliver
this type of care and can foster preventative, cost-effective measures
for those with, or at risk of developing, multimorbidity (Guthrie
\emph{et al.}, 2011; Moffat and Mercer, 2015; WHO, 2016a, 2016b; Watt,
2017; AMS, 2018; Rijken \emph{et al.}, 2018).

This is particularly true where primary care services are provided on a
universal basis which widens the scope of access to service (Guthrie
\emph{et al.}, 2011; WHO, 2016a, 2016b). That said, universal coverage
in itself does not guarantee equitable access to care. First coined by
Julian Tudor-Hart (1971), the Inverse Care Law describing reduced
availability of good medical care in areas of highest need has been
shown to be alive and well in countries with universal primary care
coverage (Watt, 2002, 2018; Mercer and Watt, 2007; McLean \emph{et al.},
2015; WHO, 2016b).

Given these many challenges, a recent Academy of Medical Sciences report
(2018) highlights a number of areas where research into multimorbidity
should be directed including: identifying trends and patterns of
multimorbidity (including clusters of conditions), the determinants of
condition clusters, prevention strategies, risk-assessment strategies,
and healthcare (re)organisation. The NICE guideline on multimorbidity
assessment and management (2016) suggests research should focus on:
organisation of (primary) care, community assessment, medicines
management, and the prediction of life expectancy. Absent from both
these guidelines, save passing references, are consideration of the
effect of multimorbidity on \emph{social} care services.

Inclusion of social care as a factor associated with multimorbidity is
justified by an earlier NICE guideline entitled, ``Older people with
social care needs and multiple long-term conditions'' (2015). As the
title suggests, the guideline frames social care needs as an additional
dimension to the assessment required for people with multimorbidity.
There are no recommendations, or indeed acknowledgement, of the effect
multimorbidity may have as a driver of need for social care. Social
support, along with other patient-relevant outcome measures (PROMs)
(such as functional disability), are often included as independent
variables indicating a modifying effect on multimorbidity rather than
outcomes where multimorbidity may be a contributing factor (Nicholson
\emph{et al.}, 2019). Recognition of this fact has led to calls for the
social context of individuals with multimorbidity to be more fully
investigated (Zullig \emph{et al.}, 2016; Smith \emph{et al.}, 2018).

Whilst this gap in knowledge is the justification for the research
carried out in the thesis, and further explored later in this chapter,
the remainder of this section will expand on the themes outlined above
with reference to multimorbidity. Those themes with particular relevance
to the thesis are covered. Firstly, an overview of literature regarding
the complexity of the concept and definition of multimorbidity is
presented. This is followed by a review of the many methods that have
been employed to measure multimorbidity. Finally, an overview of
relevant literature regarding health inequalities in the context of
multimorbidity is also presented with a specific focus on UK based
literature.

\subsection{Concepts and definitions}\label{subsec:mm-defs}

Despite the increasing importance of multimorbidity on health care
systems, there has been some debate internationally in finding an agreed
definition of the term or concept (Almirall and Fortin, 2013; Lefevre
\emph{et al.}, 2014; AMS, 2018). This section outlines the differing
terms and concepts used in academic literature.

One source of confusion that is commonly found in research relating to
two or more health conditions is in the numerous ways in which it is
labelled including: polymorbidity, polypathology, pluripathology,
multipathology, and multicondition (Almirall and Fortin, 2013). The two
most frequently used terms, multimorbidity and comorbidity, are often
(incorrectly) used interchangeably despite a distinction being
articulated over 20 years ago (van-den-Akker \emph{et al.}, 1996;
Nicholson \emph{et al.}, 2019). Comorbidity was originally described by
Fenstein (1970, p. 467) who stated, ``In a patient with a particular
index disease, the term co-morbidity refers to any additional
co-existing ailment.'' Van Den Akker \textit{et al.}. (1996, p. 65)
separated this term from multimorbidity which they described as
``\ldots any co-occurrence of medical conditions within a person.'' In
this sense, multimorbidity does not rely on the presence of a primary,
or index, disease but refers to the overall state of multiple illnesses.
The recent addition of a distinct MeSH heading for multimorbidity that
can be used to search medical literature databases signals the
importance of the difference in these terms (previously, only
comorbidity was available as a MeSH heading) (Tugwell and Knottnerus,
2019).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/chapter-lit-review/valderas_2.pdf}
    \caption{Conceptual framework of co/multimorbidity}
    \label{fig:valderas}
\end{figure}

An aide to further clarify this distinction is a broader conceptual
framework provided by Valderas \textit{et al.} (2009) (Figure
\ref{fig:valderas}) who characterise the construct of the multiple terms
found in the literature into four main groups: (a) comorbidity --
additional diseases in the context of an index disease, (b)
multimorbidity -- more than one disease within an individual (without
reference to an index disease), (c) morbidity burden -- total impact of
physiological dysfunction linked to disease severity and (d) patient
complexity -- the effect of non-health characteristics
(e.g.~deprivation, culture, environment) on the whole.

Valderas \textit{et al.}. (2009) discuss these four constructs further
in relation to three main research areas: clinical care, epidemiology \&
public health, and health service planning. It is suggested that
comorbidity may be a more valid definition for use in specialist
clinical care, whereas multimorbidity and morbidity burden would be more
appropriate in primary care research. In epidemiological and public
health research, the definitions of either comorbidity or multimorbidity
would be of use depending on the origin of the diseases being studied
and the particular research questions being investigated. Morbidity
burden and patient complexity are the most appropriate definitions for
research exploring healthcare use and costs (Valderas \emph{et al.},
2009).

Relying on the term for multimorbidity in Figure \ref{fig:valderas} does
not, however, completely solve the problem of definition. Intuitively,
the term signifies more than one condition, but which conditions should
be included? The findings of three systematic reviews have highlighted
the myriad ways researchers have approached this problem (Groot \emph{et
al.}, 2004; Diederichs \emph{et al.}, 2011; Huntley \emph{et al.},
2012). Each review aimed to collate evidence of measurement tools in
comorbidity or multimorbidity but from different perspectives: De Groot
\textit{et al.} (2004) searched for comorbidity indices to inform
research into Multiple Sclerosis, Diederichs \textit{et al.} (2011)
specifically searched for multimorbidity measurement indices, whereas
Huntley \textit{et al.} (2012) searched for measures of multimorbidity
used only in primary care research. The systematic reviews found 13, 39
and 17 exclusive ways of measuring multimorbidity or comorbidity
respectively. Adding even further complexity, the number of medical
conditions included in these measurements varied from 4 to 102
(Diederichs \emph{et al.}, 2011).

More recently, a systematic review focused on which diseases, risk
factors and symptoms are included in varying definitions of
multimorbidity (Willadsen \emph{et al.}, 2016). Whilst the majority of
included studies in the review indicated multimorbidity as the presence
of two or more conditions, Willadsen \textit{et al.} (2016) found the
total number of diseases, risk factors, and symptoms used varied from 4
to 147. Of the 167 included articles in the review, 115 different ways
of defining multimorbidity were identified (Willadsen \emph{et al.},
2016). Another review found the number of conditions used in measures of
multimorbidity varied from 5 to 335 (Violan \emph{et al.}, 2014).

Acknowledging the perverse impact this has on advancing knowledge
through research, attempts have been made to find a unifying definition
of multimorbidity that can be employed to facilitate synthesis of
research findings. These included:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]

\item \begin{quotation} ``being affected by two or more chronic health conditions in the same individual'' \hfill (WHO, 2016) \end{quotation} 

\item \begin{quotation} ``...any combination of chronic disease with at least one other disease (acute or chronic) biopsychosocial factor (associated or not) or somatic risk factor.'' \hfill (EGPRN, 2013) \end{quotation} 

\item \begin{quotation} ``more than 1 long-term condition with any of the following: \begin{itemize}[noitemsep] \item Difficulty managing treatments or day-to-day activities. \item Care from multiple services and requiring care from a new service \item Both long-term physical and mental health conditions \item Frailty \item Frequent use of unplanned or emergency care \item Prescription of multiple, regular medicines'' \end{itemize} \hfill(NICE, 2016) \end{quotation} 
\end{enumerate}

In the NICE guideline (2016) there is an agreement with other
commentators (Mercer \emph{et al.}, 2009) that basing the definition of
multimorbidity on two or more health conditions \textit{only} does not
fully capture a clinically meaningful picture of the concept. The
guideline highlights the fact that many people defined as multimorbid in
this way may not be ill and have excellent quality of life requiring
little or no health care input (NICE, 2016). Whilst definitions two and
three above attempt to address this problem, it could be argued that
they are, respectively, ambiguous and over-complex.

The most recent attempt to standardise a definition of multimorbidity
has been provided with the AMS which in less ambiguous than that
provided by the EGPRN and less complex than that posited by NICE:

\begin{quotation} ``The co-existence of two or more chronic conditions, each one of which is either \begin{itemize}[noitemsep] \item A physical non-communicable disease of long duration, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer \item A mental health condition of long duration, such as mood disorder or dementia \item An infectious disease of long duration, such as HIV or hepatitis C'' \end{itemize} \hfill (AMS, 2018) \end{quotation}

Although multimorbidity may seem to be an intuitive thing to understand,
defining a useful concept of the term has proved to be much more
difficult (Guthrie \emph{et al.}, 2011). The definition articulated by
the AMS has the benefit of being relatively concise and clear and will
be used to describe multimorbidity hereon in the thesis.

\subsection{Measurement tools}\label{subsec:mm-measures}

Adding further complexity to conducting multimorbidity research is the
many ways in which it can be measured. This section summarises
literature explaining why this is so and presents recommendations from
relevant systematic reviews.

Until recently, there were two main ways to measure multimorbidity:
simple disease counts or using an index. Indices apply weights to either
prescribed medications or medical conditions, sometimes along with other
factors, in an attempt to capture the effect of disease severity on
multimorbidity (which is crudely consistent with the term morbidity
burden (Figure \ref{fig:valderas})) (Groot \emph{et al.}, 2004;
Diederichs \emph{et al.}, 2011; Huntley \emph{et al.}, 2012). Advanced
computing power has added a third method of multimorbidity measurement
through the identification of non-random clusters of medical conditions
via statistical algorithms (Prados-Torres \emph{et al.}, 2014). These
clusters can be used to help understand the aetiology of multimorbidity,
assess the impact of clusters on health outcomes, and which determinants
of multimorbidity are associated with clusters (Prados-Torres \emph{et
al.}, 2014; AMS, 2018).

In primary care research, the most frequently used measurement is simple
disease counts (Huntley \emph{et al.}, 2012). This may be because of the
ease with which it can be administered compared to more complex indices
e.g.~the Charlson index (Charlson \emph{et al.}, 1987), the Chronic
Disease Score (CDC) (Von Korff \emph{et al.}, 1992), or the Adjusted
Clinical Group (ACG) system (Starfield \emph{et al.}, 1991) and their
variations. It could be expected that indices may capture the complexity
of multimorbidity more effectively, however Huntley \textit{et al.}
(2012) cite evidence that suggests simple counts of diseases or
medications are almost as effective at predicting mortality or health
care use in the primary care setting. Disease counts were also found by
Huntley \textit{et al.} (2012) to have good evidence to suggest they
provide a robust measure of multimorbidity in relation to quality of
life, as does the Charlson index (Charlson \emph{et al.}, 1987).

In many areas, access to data listing disease types for individuals can
be problematic. Brilleman \& Salisbury (2013) found a count of
prescribed medicines was equivalent to a number of more complex indices
when predicting primary care use and mortality in an English setting.
This confirmed results found in a study of an American cohort (Perkins
\emph{et al.}, 2004) where the authors also argued that indices
developed in the secondary care setting, such as the Charlson index,
should be used with caution in other settings despite adaptions. More
recently, Wallace \textit{et al.} (2016) found little difference between
simple (count) and complex (index) measures and that medication-based
measures were equivalent to diagnosis-based measures in predicting
outcomes. The use of medicine counts as a proxy for multimorbidity
offers a good alternative to disease-based counts or measures.

Recent research and academic discussion suggests identification of
disease clusters may enable clearer answers to clinically relevant
research questions than currently employed measures (Valderas \emph{et
al.}, 2009; Holden \emph{et al.}, 2011; Marengoni \emph{et al.}, 2011;
Sinnige \emph{et al.}, 2013; Islam \emph{et al.}, 2014; Prados-Torres
\emph{et al.}, 2014; Le Reste \emph{et al.}, 2015). In systematic
reviews of clustering methods, wide variations in approaches to
clustering and characteristics of populations studied have been found
(Prados-Torres \emph{et al.}, 2014; Ng \emph{et al.}, 2018). Statistical
techniques employed in attempts to identify such clusters include:
factor analysis, cluster analysis, the observed-to-expected ratio,
multiple correspondence analysis (Prados-Torres \emph{et al.}, 2014;
Clerencia-Sierra \emph{et al.}, 2015; Ng \emph{et al.}, 2018), principal
component analysis, latent class analysis (Islam \emph{et al.}, 2014;
Larsen \emph{et al.}, 2017), and machine learning techniques (Schiltz
\emph{et al.}, 2017).

Prados-Torres \textit{et al.} (2014) identified three groups of patterns
common to all included studies in their review despite marked
heterogeneity namely: cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, mental
health conditions, and musculoskeletal disorders. No studies have yet
demonstrated associations between clusters and health or health related
outcomes, but identification of clusters remains a research priority in
the immediate future (AMS, 2018).

\subsection{Multimorbidity and health inequalities}\label{subsec:mm-hi}

A core interest of policy-makers is the effect of ageing populations and
multimorbidity on health inequalities. This section provides a broad
overview of important themes in health inequality literature, including
the effect of health service access on inequalities.

\begin{quotation} ``Health inequalities are the systematic, avoidable and unfair differences in health outcomes that can be observed between populations, between social groups within the same population or as a gradient across a population ranked by social position." \hfill (McCartney \emph{et al.}, 2019, p.28) \end{quotation}

There is no biological reason for poorer people to have worse health or
to die earlier than the richest (Marmot, 2015). Yet over the last five
decades, despite overall trends, the most disadvantaged in society have
seen slower improvements in health and life expectancy than the most
affluent - resulting in a widening gap in health outcomes. (WHO, 2008;
Scottish-Parliament, 2015; Scottish-Government, 2018b; McCartney
\emph{et al.}, 2019). A well documented gradient running from the most
affluent to the most deprived has been observed (Graham, 2007; Marmot
\emph{et al.}, 2010). There are a number of social determinants of
health that contribute to this situation including: access to
healthcare, deprivation, quality of housing, and unemployment (Wilkinson
and Marmot, 2003; Marmot, 2005; WHO, 2008).

Health inequalities have been observed between and within countries all
over the world regardless of relative prosperity (WHO, 2008). The Black
Report (1980), published by the UK Government almost 40 years ago,
brought the subject of health inequality to international attention
(Asthana and Halliday, 2006). It both described and attempted to explain
the phenomenon present in the UK. Successive governments commissioned
subsequent reports that have described similar findings and new insights
(Whitehead, 1987; Acheson and Barker, 1998; Marmot \emph{et al.}, 2010).
However, there has been little progress in implementing recommendations
from these reports and thus little progress in reducing disparities in
health (Mackenbach, 2010; McCartney \emph{et al.}, 2012; Frank \emph{et
al.}, 2015; Smith \emph{et al.}, 2016).

In the UK, poverty remains the largest predictor of relative ill health
and has associations with increased morbidity, multimorbidity, and
decreased life expectancy (Baker \emph{et al.}, 2015). People living in
deprived areas are more likely to experience multimorbidity at a younger
age, live in overcrowded or unsuitable housing, and (potentially as a
result of socioeconomic conditions) engage in unhealthy lifestyle
behaviours (Shaw \emph{et al.}, 2006; Baker \emph{et al.}, 2015).

Figures released by the Office for National Statistics suggests the gap
in male life expectancy at birth between 2015-2017 across local
authorities was highest in England at 9.1 years; from 74.2 years in
Blackpool to 83.3 years in Hart. In Northern Ireland the gap is 4 years
and in Wales 4.1 years. Those born in East Dunbartonshire were expected
to live to 80.1 years, whereas those in neighbouring Glasgow City were
expected to live 73.3 years giving a gap of 7.2 years in Scotland (ONS,
2018). The overall UK gap in life expectancy at birth at local authority
level is, therefore, exactly ten years (between Glasgow City and Hart)
(ONS, 2018,supplementary data).

There has been some argument that research on health inequalities has
placed an over-emphasis on deprivation at the expense of understanding
the role of access to health services, particularly in the UK where
there is universal health coverage (Hellowell and Ralston, 2016). This
is important because poorer access to primary health care is associated
with greater demand for unnecessary admission to hospital which, in
turn, is responsible for higher proportions of healthcare expenditure
(Rosano \emph{et al.}, 2013; Weston \emph{et al.}, 2016).

Research in countries where markets play a greater role in health care
delivery, such as the USA, are more likely to produce literature
focussing on service access (Hellowell and Ralston, 2016). This is
likely due to the fact that those of lower socioeconomic position are
less able to pay market-price for health care - thus reducing access.
This underpins the theory of the ``inverse care law'' which states that,

\begin{quotation} ``The availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it, in the population served. This inverse care law operates more completely where medical care is most exposed to market forces, and less so where exposure is reduced.'' \hfill{Tudor-Hart, 1971}\end{quotation}

There are, however, statistics and research showing that universal
health care in itself does not guard against the inverse care law.

People living in more deprived areas have lower life expectancy, are
more likely to have multimorbidities and therefore have greater health
needs (Baker \emph{et al.}, 2015). However, the poorest neighbourhoods
in England have been reported to have 62.5 GPs per 100,000 population
whereas the most affluent neighbourhoods have 76.2 per 100,000 (CfWI,
2014). This suggests health provision does not match need - indicating
the presence of the inverse care law (Watt, 2002, 2018; Marmot, 2018).
Recent planned changes in policy to distribute primary care funding
based on population age are likely to exacerbate this situation (Mercer
\emph{et al.}, 2012). Indeed, increases in workload with deteriorating
budgets has led the King's Fund to describe the situation in primary
care in England and Wales as ``in crisis'' (Baird \emph{et al.}, 2016,
p. 3).

Equalising the number of GPs across geographic areas does not, on its
own, solve the issue of equitable access to service. In Scotland, there
is an even distribution of GP workforce among the population. However,
in the most deprived areas GPs need to provide more consultations, for
patients with more complex needs, at the same funding level as practices
with fewer resource demands (Mercer and Watt, 2007; McLean \emph{et
al.}, 2015). The inverse care law is alive and well in the UK, despite
universal coverage.

There are many theories as to why inequalities in health exist across
socioeconomic position (Asthana and Halliday, 2006; Nettleton, 2006;
McCartney \emph{et al.}, 2019) with intensive research dating back to
the Black Report published by the UK government (Black, 1980). Some of
these, such as statistical artefact and biological reasons, were
rejected as being implausible by the Black Report (Macintyre, 1997). To
a large extent, epidemiological evidence and theoretical argument has
agreed with that view (Asthana and Halliday, 2006; Nettleton, 2006;
Mackenbach, 2012; McCartney \emph{et al.}, 2013).

Of the other theories proposed in the last 35 years, there have been
many critiques and a number of proposals (Asthana and Halliday, 2006;
Nettleton, 2006; Peckham and Meerabeau, 2007; Mackenbach, 2012; Smith
\emph{et al.}, 2016). Whilst arguments over which theory is most
plausible to explain the cause of health inequality, most researchers
agree on ways to remedy disparities in health outcome. These are the
redistribution of income, wealth, and political power (Asthana and
Halliday, 2006; Nettleton, 2006; Katikireddi \emph{et al.}, 2013; Smith
\emph{et al.}, 2016). Although health services have an important role to
play, it is the ``upstream'' policies of redistribution that will make
the biggest impacts in improving health outcomes across society (Asthana
and Halliday, 2006; Katikireddi \emph{et al.}, 2013;
Scottish-Parliament, 2015; Smith \emph{et al.}, 2016). Whilst this has
been known for some time, government policies in the UK to date have not
addressed these issues and have thus failed to make meaningful
improvements in health inequalities (Peckham and Meerabeau, 2007;
Mackenbach, 2010; Frank \emph{et al.}, 2015).

\subsection{Summary}\label{subsec:mm-summary}

Multimorbidity is most commonly defined as the presence (or
co-occurrence) of two or more long-term conditions in an individual.
Debate continues as to the type and number of long-term conditions that
should be included to provide a meaningful concept for individuals,
clinicians and healthcare organisations. The most recent definition
posited by the AMS aims to capture the broad concept of multimorbidity
whilst remaining concise and clear.

There are myriad ways of measuring multimorbidity with various counts of
different diseases, indices, and clusters. The best way to measure
multimorbidity for research depends on the setting and questions to be
answered. Where good data is difficult to come by, simple counts of
diseases or medicines have been shown to have proved comparable to
predicting mortality and health care use as more complicated indices.

Evidence suggests multimorbidity is increasing in prevalence and has a
strong socioeconomic pattern. This pattern has implications for health
inequalities, particularly through increased need and access to
services. Empirical evidence of the inverse care law in UK primary care
poses hard questions for policy makers in the context of financial
austerity.

Very little research has been conducted into the effects of
multimorbidity on social care services, despite acknowledgement that an
interaction is likely to exist. Given the increasing prevalence of
multimorbidity, understanding the relationship with social care services
is of paramount importance in order for policies and services to be
adequately allocated.

\section{Social Care}\label{sec:access-sc}

Before exploring any interaction between multimorbidity and social care,
it is necessary to first explore the concept of social care in
isolation. This section reviews literature on: definitions of social
care, how social care is delivered in an international context, how
resources for social care are allocated in the UK, how eligibility
criteria are determined in the UK, and provides an overview of relevant
social theory literature with regards to service allocation and access.

\subsection{Context}\label{subsec:sc-context}

As with multimorbidity, there are many ways of defining social care.
What would be described as social care in the UK (Humphries \emph{et
al.}, 2016) is often called long-term care (LTC) in other countries
(Deusdad \emph{et al.}, 2016). The next section
(\ref{subsec:access-sc-defs}) investigates in detail the differing
definitions of social care, but in general the term refers to services
provided to those that struggle with activities of daily living to
enable them to live as full a life as possible (BMA, 2014; Deusdad
\emph{et al.}, 2016; National-Audit-Office, 2018).

There are four ways in which social care can be provided to those in
need: informally via family or community, formally via voluntary
non-profit organisations, formally via the state, or formally via
for-profit organisations (Munday, 2003). In Europe, increasing demand
from users has led to many welfare systems being unable to adequately
provide care (Pavolini and Ranci, 2008; Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011).
Changes in demography, the labour market, democracy, and values have all
contributed to the increasing pressure on formal care services
(Anttonen, 2005; Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011; OECD/EU, 2013). A recent
study found that increased demand for services was fuelled not only by
the increase in the overall number of older people, but also the fact
that they live longer periods of their life with care needs (Kingston
\emph{et al.}, 2017). Some argue this should be considered a triumph of
modern medicine even though it raises concerns for individuals and
societies about how to provide and pay for these additional care needs
(Dilnot, 2017).

There is wide consensus that lower birth rates and higher proportions of
older people mean that a gap has emerged in the number of adult children
able to provide informal care to their parents (Munday, 2003; Anttonen,
2005; Pavolini and Ranci, 2008; Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011; Robertson
\emph{et al.}, 2014; Deusdad \emph{et al.}, 2016). Traditionally,
informal care was provided overwhelmingly by women. As gender equality
improves, more women are employed in non-domestic settings which has
reduced the pool of informal social care available (Anttonen, 2005).
Anttonen (2005) also cites changes in societal attitudes from
``familism'' to ``individualism'' as having an impact on informal care
resources. These combined factors mean that informal care services are
no longer as readily available and formal care mechanisms are
increasingly required to provide social care. Pressures on these
services has seen increased discussion and comparison of models of care
across Europe over the last 20 years (Anttonen and Sipilä, 1996; Munday,
2003; Sapir, 2006; Fernández-Alonso and Jaime-Castillo, 2016).

These issues are particularly salient given financial constraints in
public funding following the financial crash of 2008. (Humphries
\emph{et al.}, 2016; Deusdad \emph{et al.}, 2016; Bottery \emph{et al.},
2018). In countries where a large proportion of services are provided
from the public purse, austerity measures have resulted in cuts in the
number of people receiving social care (Burchardt \emph{et al.}, 2015;
Humphries \emph{et al.}, 2016; Deusdad \emph{et al.}, 2016). Indeed,
social care provision in England covers only the poorest of individuals
with the highest care needs (Ham, 2019). There is little research
detailing the impact this has had on those no longer receiving formal
care services although increases in avoidable admissions to, and delayed
discharges from, hospital in the UK are one outcome the cuts are thought
to contribute to (Charlesworth and Thorlby, 2012; Humphries \emph{et
al.}, 2016).

In the UK there is an important difference between social care and
health care funding and access. Health care is universally provided free
at the point of need by the NHS. Social care is commissioned by local,
rather than central, government and is both means-tested (with the
exception of free personal care in Scotland) and needs-tested (Burchardt
\emph{et al.}, 2015, 2018; Humphries \emph{et al.}, 2016). There are,
however, many areas where the services overlap (BMA, 2014). These
arrangements are poorly understood by the public, many of whom only find
out they are required to pay for social care at the moment they first
need it (Humphries \emph{et al.}, 2016; Bottery \emph{et al.}, 2018).

Some argue that social care has been relegated in terms of policy
importance because is not directly provided by national government
(Burchardt \emph{et al.}, 2015). The most recent UK government social
care green paper has been delayed on numerous occasions (Atkins, 2019)
which may indicate political apprehension in addressing the difficult
decisions that are required in order to find a funding solution for
social care (Bottery \emph{et al.}, 2018; Ham, 2019). This may be due to
the negative effect on electoral success encountered by political
parties willing to discuss these difficulties at the 2010 and 2017
general elections (Bottery \emph{et al.}, 2018). Nevertheless, state
intervention of some kind is the only way of addressing the gap between
supply and demand as private insurers are unwilling to enter the social
care market due to the unpredictability of risk (Dilnot, 2017; Bottery
\emph{et al.}, 2018; Ham, 2019).

In 2002, the recommendations of a Royal Commission on long-term care for
older people (Sutherland, 1999) were ignored by the UK government.
Scotland was the only part of the UK to implement the policy of free
personal care for those over the age of 65 - regardless of means (Bowes
and Bell, 2007). The policy, which is still subject to a needs-test, has
more recently been extended to all adults (Scottish-Government, 2019).
Although the removal of a means-test for free personal care eases some
of the financial burden for users, access to care is still regulated
through the needs-test. Overall numbers of individuals in Scotland
receiving social care are continuing to fall which suggests eligibility
criteria for receiving care are tightening. Moreover, free personal care
does not remove the most expensive outlay in terms of social care -
namely the high costs of residential care (Bowes and Bell, 2007).

This section reviews literature on these broad issues in more depth in
five sections. The first section outlines definitions of social care and
related terms. Next, the varying ways social care is delivered
internationally are investigated. The third and fourth sections review
literature on resource allocation and eligibility criteria respectively,
where necessary distinguishing between policy differences in Scotland
compared to the rest of the UK. The final section presents literature
relating to social theory of resource allocation, eligibility for
services, and the impact of social care on health inequalities.

\subsection{Definitions}\label{subsec:access-sc-defs}

This section identifies the different ways social care has been defined
in literature in the UK and internationally. Further definitions
relevant to the thesis, particularly in relation to social care services
provided in Scotland, are also discussed.

\subsubsection{Social care}\label{subsubsec:sc-def}

There is no internationally (or nationally) accepted definition of
social care. Indeed, the difference between what is social care and what
is health care has no clear line of demarcation resulting in local
variation in provision of services (McDonald, 2006). A recent NICE
guideline (2015) addressing social care needs for older people with
multiple chronic conditions used a definition provided in the UK Health
and Social Care Act (2012):

\begin{quotation}
    `` ``Adult social care”—
    ... includes all forms of personal care and other practical assistance provided for individuals who, by reason of age, illness, disability, pregnancy, childbirth, dependence on alcohol or drugs, or any other similar circumstances, are in need of such care or other assistance, ...” \hfill{The Health and Social Care Act  2012 c7, Part 3, Chapter 1, Section 65, Subsection 4}\end{quotation}

The NICE guideline (2015) advises that social care planning for people
with multimorbidity should include holistic assessment of
biopsychosocial factors including sexual, spiritual, cultural, and
communication needs. It should also consider access to leisure and
social activities whilst incorporating issues regarding mobility and
transport. Specifically, the guideline cites: self-care, taking
medicines, learning, volunteering, maintaining a home, financial
management, employment, socialising with friends, and hobbies as
activities that all patients should be able to take part in should they
wish to. Social care assessment should assess the ability of the
individual to achieve this.

A more succinct definition of social care is used in a report to the
Minister for Care Services at the UK Department of Health:

\begin{quotation}
    ``The group of services that provide personal care and support to people in social situations – such as family; the community; a communal setting; to help them achieve independence and to promote their positive contribution as citizens." \hfill{Platt, 2007,p.4}\end{quotation}

Huxley \textit{et al.} (2007) are critical of this service-based
definition and argue that social care is intended to improve general
well-being for those that are in need. As quality of life is an
important factor of well-being, Huxley \textit{et al.} (2007) argue that
wider issues regarding environment and the quality of public and private
services also play an important role in social care. Indeed, Daly and
Lewis (2000, p. 287) argue that social care is ``\ldots an activity and
set of relations lying at the intersection of state, market, family (and
voluntary sector) relations''.

This view is reflected in an aspirational constitution for social care
published by an independent, cross-party think-tank (Bartlett and
Guglielmi, 2009). The authors argue that all citizens should have an
equal ability to live and control a full and active life. Where this is
not possible, the state should have a duty to provide the necessary
help, in whatever form that is required, to individuals who require it.

These definitions benefit from being somewhat succinct but fail to
articulate the range of interdisciplinary services that are sometimes
required for social care users. Two further definitions, provided in
international reports, go some way to addressing this shortfall. The
OECD and the EU jointly published a report on long-term care for older
people discussing much of what may be described in the UK as social
care. In the report, long-term care is defined as:

\begin{quotation}
``... a range of services required by persons with a reduced degree of functional capacity, physical or cognitive, and who are consequently dependent for an extended period of time on help with basic activities of daily living (ADL). This ``personal care" component is frequently provided in combination with help with basic medical services such as ``nursing care" (wound dressing, pain management, medication, health monitoring), as well as prevention, rehabilitation or palliative care. Long-term care services can also be combined with lower level care related to ``domestic help” or help with instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)."\hfill{OECD/EU, 2013,p.38}\end{quotation}

The second definition provided by Colombo \textit{et al.} (2011)
classifies social care as:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label={\alph*)}]
\item a group of services such as: skilled nursing care, social work, personal care, medical equipment \& technologies, and therapies. Delivered by,   
\item a range of  professionals such as: nurses, low-skilled carers, or allied health professionals. In,  
\item various locations such as: at home, in an institution, or via community care.
\end{enumerate}

Both this and the previous OECD/EU definition clearly capture the broad
range of services that can be associated with social care that are only
partially provided in other definitions. They acknowledge that social
care can include a number of components including personal, nursing
care, and help with other domestic activities. They also implicitly
identify that social care can include components of \emph{health} care.
The latter definition also articulates the variety of settings where
this can take place and provides examples of the differing professional
capacities of individuals that may provide care. These additional
references result in a more complete (and still succinct) definition and
will be used for the purposes of this thesis although the use of the
term ``low-skilled'' to describe carers is contentious.

Whilst it is common in Europe to describe ``long-term care'' in relation
to these services, this thesis will refer to ``social care'' as this is
the most commonly used term in the UK. Furthermore, unless stated
otherwise, reference to social care in this thesis will be with regard
to care received by adults over the age of 65.

\subsubsection{Scottish service definitions}\label{subsubsec:scot-subserv}

The Social Care Survey (SCS) is collected annually by the Scottish
Government to provide statistics of the type and amounts of social care
delivered by each of Scotland's 32 local authorities
(Scottish-Government, 2017e). The SCS is used for empirical analysis in
later chapters of this thesis and a description of its collection is
provided in Section \ref{subsec:source-sc}. However, whilst many of the
services of social care delivered by local authorities are
self-explanatory (e.g.~shopping or laundry), some require fuller
explanations which are provided here.

The term ``home care" can refer to a number of services delivered to
individuals in their own home (Gatherum and MacAskill, 2017) which are
described in Table \ref{tab:methods-homecaredefs}.

\begin{table}[h]
\rowcolors{2}{white}{gray!10}
\centering
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Type of home care} & \textbf{Definition} \\ \midrule
Care at Home (Mainstream) & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}The aim of care at home is to help vulnerable people of all ages live independently and securely in their\\  own homes by providing personal and housing support services.

\end{tabular}%
}
\caption{Definitions of home care types}
\label{tab:methods-homecaredefs}
\end{table}

The SCS also identifies individuals who are specifically receiving
``personal care''. As previously discussed in Section
\ref{subsec:sc-context}, personal care is provided for free in Scotland
but not in the rest of the UK. Given this variation, an accurate
definition of personal care is important. The legislation implementing
free personal care, introduced by the then Scottish Executive,
articulated a clear definition which constitutes six dimensions, and
which is used to identify eligibility for receipt of free care (Cavaye,
2006, p. 256).

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item personal hygiene: washing etc.  
\item personal assistance: help with dressings, prostheses etc.  
\item continence management: toileting, catheter management etc.  
\item food and diet: help with eating, food preparation etc.  
\item problems of immobility:  
\item simple treatments: help with medicines, creams, oxygen therapy etc. 
\end{itemize}

Other services the SCS collects data on are receipt of ``community
alarm'' and ``other telecare services'' (Scottish-Government, 2017e).
Individuals are defined as receiving a community alarm if they are:

\begin{quotation} ``A person in receipt of a technology package which consists of a communication hub (either an individual home hub unit or part of a communal system e.g. the alarm system within sheltered housing), and a button/pull chord/pendant which transfers an alert/alarm/data to a monitoring centre or individual responder." \end{quotation}

Whereas an individual is defined as receiving telecare if they are:

\begin{quotation} ``A person in receipt of a technology package which goes over the basic community alarm package..., and includes any other sensors or monitoring equipment e.g. (not an exhaustive list): linked pill dispensers, linked smoke detectors, linked key safes, bogus caller buttons and door entry systems, property exit sensors, [or] extreme temperature, flood, falls, [or] movement detectors." \hfill{Scottish-Government, 2017c, p.30}\end{quotation}

The final service requiring specific definition is that of
``self-directed support'' (SDS). This service was introduced in Scotland
in 2013 to provide eligible social care users with more choice in how
they received their care via four options: a) by choosing and arranging
their own support and managing the budget to do so as a direct payment,
b) by choosing the type of support they received and delegating the
local authority or other organisation to arrange the care and manage the
budget, c) by delegating the local authority to choose and arrange the
support, or d) a mixture of each of the previous options
(Audit-Scotland, 2017; Gatherum and MacAskill, 2017). Notably, the
recent Audit Scotland report into SDS (2017) identified that very small
numbers of individuals have been offered or taken up any of these
options.

\subsection{International models of social care}\label{subsec:access-sc-models}

In a report for the OECD, Colombo \textit{et al.} (2011) categorised the
varying models of social care employed internationally into three main
groups with subdivisions as shown in Table \ref{tab:oecd-soc-care}.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
    \begin{threeparttable}
      \begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
        \toprule
          \textbf{Model} & \textbf{Countries where employed} \\ \midrule
          \textbf{Universal coverage} &  \\
          a) tax based & Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland \\
          b) public long-term insurance & Germany, Japan, South Korea, Netherlands, Luxembourg \\
          c) health system & Belgium \\
          \textbf{Mixed systems} &  \\
          a) parallel universal schemes & Scotland, Italy, Czech Republic,                 Poland \\
          b) income-related universal benefit or subsidy & Ireland, Australia,              Austria, France \\
          c) mix of universal and means-tested (or no) benefit & Switzerland, New Zealand, some Canadian Provinces, Spain, and Greece\tnote{1} \\
          \textbf{Means-tested safety net} & England, USA \\
          \bottomrule
          \end{tabular}
          \begin{tablenotes}
        \item Adapted from Colombo \textit{et al.} (2011)
        \item[1] Spain and Greece have less well developed formal care services
      \end{tablenotes}
  \end{threeparttable}%
  }
  \caption{Models of social care in OECD countries}
  \label{tab:oecd-soc-care}
\end{table}

Universal models of social care are characterised by: a) a single system
being in place for delivery of services, b) nursing \textit{and}
personal care are provided for all individuals meeting defined
eligibility criteria, and c) some form of charge is levied on
service-users (Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011). Three subdivisions of
universal coverage social care models are identified in this
classification.

The tax-based universal models, also known as the Nordic model of care,
have strong local-government influence in both the raising of funds and
delivery of services (Munday, 2003; Sapir, 2006; Colombo \emph{et al.},
2011; Fernández-Alonso and Jaime-Castillo, 2016). Overall responsibility
remains with national government which also contributes funds, often
dependent on local population need and structure (Colombo \emph{et al.},
2011). Public long-term insurance schemes are mandatory in the countries
that employ them, although the age at which citizens begin to contribute
varies (e.g.~only over 40s contribute in Japan) (Colombo \emph{et al.},
2011; Forder and Fernández, 2011; Eleftheriades and Wittenberg, 2013).
These models have found it increasingly difficult to fund provision and
have either increased user-payments or decreased coverage in recent
years (Forder and Fernández, 2011; Eleftheriades and Wittenberg, 2013;
Robertson \emph{et al.}, 2014). In Belgium, social care is viewed as a
health risk and is financed through the health system with a cap on
user-contribution. This results in a medical (rather than social) model
of care delivery, mostly provided by nurses (Colombo \emph{et al.},
2011).

In contrast to universal models described above where a single system is
in place for social care delivery, mixed social care systems employ
either: a) universal coverage via different sources/sectors or b) a
mixture of universal and means-tested benefits (Colombo \emph{et al.},
2011). Whilst acknowledging the wide variation in systems, Colombo
\textit{et al.} (2011) identify three subdivisions of mixed system
models of social care as shown in Table \ref{tab:oecd-soc-care}.

Parallel universal schemes provide social care via two or more sectors
(e.g.~nursing care via health provider and personal care from a
non-healthcare source, as seen in Scotland) (Colombo \emph{et al.},
2011). Major differences exist between countries in how this is
delivered in practice with varying degrees of coverage. Income related
universal benefits provide needs-based universal coverage of social
care, but benefits received vary according to income (Colombo \emph{et
al.}, 2011). France provides a good example of this system where cash
benefits are need \textit{and} income based - benefits are paid at six
levels of dependency, those with higher incomes are paid proportionally
less and top-up care costs themselves (Glendinning and Bell, 2008;
Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011). The final subdivision of mixed social care
models has some universal entitlements provided alongside means-tested
services e.g.~free provision of nursing care with means-testing for
personal care.

Colombo \textit{et al.} (2011) include Spain and Greece in this final
subdivision of mixed social care models but note these countries have
formal care systems that are much less developed than elsewhere in the
OECD. Sometimes referred to as the Mediterranean model, informal care
from family and other sources constitutes the main form of social care
in these countries (Munday, 2003; Sapir, 2006; Verbeek-Oudijk \emph{et
al.}, 2014; Fernández-Alonso and Jaime-Castillo, 2016). As this role is
traditionally carried out by women, the Mediterranean model has
attracted criticism from a feminist perspective (Munday, 2003).

The final model in Colombo \textit{et al.}'s (2011) classification of
social care in OECD countries is the means-tested safety net model
(Table \ref{tab:oecd-soc-care}). In this model only those below a
pre-determined threshold are entitled to state-provided social care.
Despite the free provision of health care and some non-means-tested
benefits, England is included in this category in the report. Presumably
this is due to the fact that state support in a residential home in
England is provided only after an individual has depleted both income
\textit{and} assets below a threshold (Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011), a
system not seen in other countries (Glendinning and Bell, 2008). A cap
of £72,000 total contribution was to be introduced in 2016 following the
recommendations of the Dilnot Commission (Dilnot, 2011; Eleftheriades
and Wittenberg, 2013), however this plan was subsequently dropped by the
UK government in 2017 (BBC-News, 2017; McKenna, 2017).

Of the three models of social care described in this section, universal
systems can be seen as having a number of advantages over the other two
(Glendinning and Bell, 2008; Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011). Sharing the
burden of social care provision among the entire population, either via
general taxation or mandatory insurance schemes, results in a reliable,
predictable source of finance enabling states to plan more effectively
(Glendinning and Bell, 2008; Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011; Forder and
Fernández, 2011). Mixed systems of social care can still result in
considerable costs for those that require care, whereas the costs to
individuals in the means-tested system can be ``catastrophic'' (Colombo
\emph{et al.}, 2011, p. pp240). The means-tested system can also be
perceived as unfair for those that need to sell assets (such as a house)
to pay for care, particularly when there is variation in eligibility
criteria within countries (Glendinning and Bell, 2008; Colombo \emph{et
al.}, 2011; Forder and Fernández, 2011; Charlesworth and Thorlby, 2012;
Eleftheriades and Wittenberg, 2013). A particular advantage of a
universal social care system is that it:

\begin{quotation} 
``...generally reduces utilisation of more expensive health care services and professionals (e.g. hospital care, doctors) for long-term care needs, for example by making ``social hospitalisation" of frail people with [social care] needs more difficult." \hfill(Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011, p.222)\end{quotation}

Given the pressures on state budgets and the desire to adequately fund
care services, this seems a particularly useful benefit of the universal
coverage model of social care.

Disadvantages of universal systems are that they are generally more
expensive to the state than other models of social care and can reduce
the amount of informal care provided by relatives for elderly family
(Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011; Eleftheriades and Wittenberg, 2013). The
comprehensiveness of coverage can be over-burdensome for the state with
a number of countries recently having to cut service or increase
user-contributions to compensate for increasing demand (Forder and
Fernández, 2011; Charlesworth and Thorlby, 2012; Eleftheriades and
Wittenberg, 2013; Robertson \emph{et al.}, 2014).

A recent examination of the effects of the 2008 financial crisis on the
way social care is delivered across Europe suggests that the
distinctions between social care models is beginning to blur (Deusdad
\emph{et al.}, 2016). There is evidence those with more comprehensive
coverage are reducing levels of care whilst those with less coverage are
increasing provision (Colombo \emph{et al.}, 2011; Verbeek-Oudijk
\emph{et al.}, 2014).

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/chapter-lit-review/oecd-comparison.pdf}
    \caption{Percentage of over-65s in selected OECD countries receiving long-term care, 2008}
    \label{fig:oecd-comparison}
\end{figure}

Given the marked variations in how social care is funded and delivered
across countries, it may be expected that there are also marked
variations in levels of access and utilisation. Colombo \textit{et al.}
(2011) produced a chart (shown in Figure \ref{fig:oecd-comparison})
derived from OECD data that shows the proportion of over 65s receiving
some form of social care across countries for which data is provided.
The chart shows that having a universal or mixed system of social care
provision (as described above) does not absolutely influence the number
of people receiving care. For example, South Korea employs a universal
(insurance-based) system and has one of the lowest proportions of older
people receiving care, whereas Switzerland has one of the highest whilst
employing a mixed system involving some universal and some means-tested
benefits. This suggests that allocation of resources and eligibility
criteria set within countries, as well as informal care, are likely to
be more important in determining access to formal social care than any
particular system of care delivery.

\subsection{Eligibility for social care in the UK}\label{subsubsec:eligibility-uk}

\setlength{\epigraphwidth}{0.7\textwidth}

\epigraph{``It is through the eligibility criteria that resources are rationed, that is ``need" is equated with ``resources available". This mechanism severely limited the idea that provision could be determined either by need or by the right to services."}{Sharkey, 2006, p.10}

A significant difference between Scotland and the rest of the UK is that
in the former no means-test is included for receipt of personal or
nursing care whether this is provided at home or in a residential
setting (Bowes and Bell, 2007; Burchardt \emph{et al.}, 2018). In
England, by contrast there is a strict means-test and this has resulted
in only those with the lowest wealth and greatest need receiving any
form of public-funded care (Bottery \emph{et al.}, 2018). An individual
will only receive full state funding for their care if their wealth
assets are below a lower threshold of £14,250. Partial funding is
provided where assets are between this figure and an upper threshold of
£23,250. Any individual with assets over £23,250 must pay for all
aspects of their care (Humphries \emph{et al.}, 2016; Bottery \emph{et
al.}, 2018; The-King's-Fund, 2018; Department-of-Health-and-Social-Care,
2019).

Adding confusion to this system is the definition of ``asset'' in the
means-test which varies depending on the type of care received. If a
permanent move to a care home is required, home-owners' houses are
included as an asset. If non-residential home care is required, the
house is not included as an asset (Bottery \emph{et al.}, 2018;
The-King's-Fund, 2018). Estimates suggest over half of all care home
fees in England are paid for by individuals (or their families) with
approximately £1bn in fees paid annually from private sources (Humphries
\emph{et al.}, 2016).

Across the UK there are variations in means-testing thresholds and
services to which they are applicable as described in a King's Fund
report (2018). The lower and upper threshold values in the means-test in
England are the same in Northern Ireland but only apply to personal and
nursing care - accommodation costs being free from the means-test. Wales
has a more generous upper threshold of £40,001 applicable to all forms
of care with no lower threshold. The lower and upper thresholds of
£16,500 and £26,500 in Scotland are only applicable to accommodation
costs (which can be the most expensive outlay) (Bell and Bowes, 2006;
The-King's-Fund, 2018). All over the UK, means-tests have not changed in
line with inflation meaning fewer people are eligible as time
progresses. For example, in England, financial thresholds are 12\% lower
in real-terms in 2018/19 compared with 2010/11 (Thornby \emph{et al.},
2018; Phillips and Sampson, 2018).

Regardless of threshold level, some individuals in all four UK nations
(estimated as 1-in-10 in England) will be unlucky enough to have to pay
very high care costs (over £100,000 towards social care over their
lifetime in some cases) which cannot be insured against (Dilnot, 2011;
The-King's-Fund, 2018). These costs have been described as
``catastrophic'' (The-King's-Fund, 2018) and are widely seen as unfair
(Dilnot, 2017).

Given these issues with means-tests, the criteria governing eligibility
via needs-testing for receiving social care are important - and
contentious. Needs-testing in all UK countries is carried out via
assessment by a social worker. In Scotland, personal care is provided
free for those that are deemed eligible but there is considerable
variation across local authorities in how eligibility is determined -
which is discussed in more detail below.

In 2010 the Scottish Government published a report written in
conjunction with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities~(COSLA)
(Scottish-Government, 2010) and included the recommendation that the
National Eligibility Framework developed by the Sutherland review into
free personal and nursing care (2008) should be applied across all
social care services. The framework has four criteria for assessing risk
in relation to a person's care needs: critical, substantial, moderate
and low (Scottish-Government, 2015b). The critical and substantial
levels of risk indicate social care needs should be addressed
immediately or imminently, whereas a moderate level of risk may indicate
either some or no services being required. There is no explicit
description of ``severity'', or which care needs fall into each
category. In practice each local authority sets the criteria and decides
at which level of risk they will provide social care
(Scottish-Government, 2014) and thus the authorities have a big
influence on how individuals can access social care services.

Equity of access to services is directly influenced by the eligibility
framework. Indeed, the strategy for self-directed support
(Scottish-Government, 2010, p. 20) acknowledges this and states that
such a framework ``\ldots can result in resources being narrowly focused
on individuals with acute needs.'' However, the report goes on to state
that growing demand and finite resources requires some form of
eligibility assessment, but this should not have a disproportionate
effect on any one group of people requiring care.

The eligibility framework allows each local authority to set thresholds
for access to care in line with local priorities and resources. This has
the effect that access to services varies across differing council
areas. The potential for regional variation is acknowledged by the
strategy for self-directed support (Scottish-Government, 2010, p. 20)
which states that, ``\ldots further work will be undertaken by the
Scottish Government and COSLA to assess whether there is merit in
establishing national thresholds for access to formal support across all
client groups.''

Acknowledgement of problems with eligibility criteria and the promise of
``further work'' to be undertaken by the Scottish Government and COSLA
is repeated in practitioner guidance on Self-Directed Support published
in 2014 (Scottish-Government, 2014, p. 19) and that, ``\ldots it remains
the case that local authorities should operate eligibility criteria to
determine whether or not an individual assessed as having social care
needs can access formal support and if so, which of their needs are to
be met by that support.''

Data is not available on levels of care provided by LAs for each of the
National Eligibility Framework criteria or for the threshold that each
LA provides care at. The Scottish Government collects an annual report
of eligibility and waiting times for the first quarter of the year. A
recent report (Scottish-Government, 2015b) provides information on the
time individuals had to wait to receive assessment and the time
individuals had to wait to receive care in the period January-March for
the preceding five years. However, no absolute number of people in each
category is provided.

The Scottish National Eligibility Framework has striking similarities to
that formerly used in England and described in Fair Access to Care
Services (FACS) produced by the Social Care Institute for Excellence
(SCIE) (2013). Exactly the same nomenclature is used to describe the
eligibility categories of need. Newton and Browne (2008) critiqued a
previous version of the FACS guidance and found similar issues to those
raised above regarding regional variations in service and concentration
of services on those with the highest need. Their paper describes
further issues with access to social care in the context of social
theory described by Lipsky (1979) and ``street-level bureaucracy''
(discussed in Section \ref{subsec:soc-theory}), where intentional and
unintentional judgement of entitlement by social care workers have an
impact on whether an individual receives care or not. Newton and Browne
(2008) also make the assertion that health and social care has never
been accessed equitably by arguing that those with a greater ability to
articulate needs and negotiate access are more likely to gain access to
services (articulated by the theory of ``candidacy'' also discussed in
Section \ref{subsec:soc-theory}). Although no citation is provided to
back-up this argument, it has certainly been described elsewhere
(Matthews and Hastings, 2013) and sits well in the broader discussion of
inequitable access to services (Tudor-Hart, 1971; Le Grand, 1982;
Hastings \emph{et al.}, 2014).

In England, the Care Act (HM-Government, 2014b) aimed to reduce regional
variations in eligibility in access to social care by imposing national
minimum thresholds that local authorities would have a statutory
obligation to provide. The Care Act also aimed to ensure local
authorities provided care, ``\ldots as early as possible to help
maintain well-being and independence, and potentially delay a situation
where longer-term care and support might be required.'' (SCIE, 2015, p.
2). The minimum criteria for being eligible for care involves an
individual having needs that impairs their ability to meet two or more
of a designated list of outcomes (e.g.~managing and maintaining
nutrition or maintaining hygiene) (SCIE, 2015) and is set by the
Secretary of State for Health (Abrahams \emph{et al.}, 2014).

In practice, the most likely outcome is that the minimum threshold that
local authorities will have to provide care will be similar to the
``critical'' level of the National Eligibility Framework previously used
in the FACS guidance (Abrahams \emph{et al.}, 2014; Burchardt \emph{et
al.}, 2015); and similar to that used in Scotland. This will legalise a
shift that has already been occurring in England where fewer local
authorities are providing care for those with ``moderate'' needs and
more are only providing care for those with ``critical'' needs
(Charlesworth and Thorlby, 2012; Abrahams \emph{et al.}, 2014; Burchardt
\emph{et al.}, 2015). Burchardt \textit{et al.} (2015) state that only
2\% of English local authorities will have to widen their care threshold
whereas 12\% could now, legally, offer services to fewer people as a
result of the Care Act.

A recent report by the House of Commons Communities and Local Government
Committee (House-of-Commons, 2017) confirmed reductions in the absolute
number of people receiving care, the concentration of services in those
with highest needs only, reduction in quality of care provided, and the
resulting pressures this caused to the health service through increased
emergency admissions and delayed discharges. The report highlights the
perilous state of social care provision in England and urges immediate
attention from the government to address funding shortfalls.

Burchardt \textit{et al.}. (2015) and Abrahams \textit{et al.}. (2014)
recognise some positive changes to social care policy through the Health
and Social Care Act but are damning about past UK government social care
policy in England and Wales. They cite chronic underfunding and cuts for
over ten years resulting in fewer people receiving care at a time when
demand is sharply increasing due to demographic change. The
``intensification'' of services on those with the most acute needs is
cited by both sets of authors as counter-productive -- ignoring those
with moderate care needs completely derails one of the main purposes of
the Care Act, preventative services. Indeed,

\begin{quotation}
    “As well as lacking in moral sense, such an approach is economically unsound. Waiting for people to have high needs before providing care means that care will be more expensive, as well as pushing more older people into an already pressurised NHS” \hfill (Abrahams \textit{et al.}, p.5). \end{quotation}

More recent research suggests that those with moderate care needs are
much more likely to have unmet need as informal care is unable to fill
the gap left by formal care service (Burchardt \emph{et al.}, 2018;
Brimblecombe \emph{et al.}, 2018)

A similar picture has been seen in Scotland where most councils now only
provide care assessed as having Critical or Substantial risk
(Audit-Scotland, 2016c). Absolute numbers of people receiving home care
has steadily fallen over the last 10 years from under 70 per thousand
aged over 65 in 2006, to under 50 per thousand in 2015 (Audit-Scotland,
2016c). At the same time, the number of hours of care provided has
increased reflecting the ``intensification'' of services discussed above
(Scottish-Government, 2017e). There are wide variations in the number of
hours of home care provided per population across local authorities
(Audit-Scotland, 2012; Scottish-Government, 2017e). This may reflect
different demographic make-up of each local authority although
reductions in ratios per population can be seen in almost all local
authorities (Scottish-Government, 2017e). Audit Scotland (2012) also
highlighted that intensifying services is likely to be a short-term
solution with negative long-term impacts and suggests comparison of
performance across Scotland would be beneficial in identifying good
practice.

In a report profiling the care at home sector in Scotland, MacLeod and
Mair (2015) describe large decreases in absolute numbers of people
receiving care at home over the ten years to 2013. There have also been
significant reductions in the number of people receiving non-personal
care (so called ``mopping and shopping''). The increase in the number of
hours of home care delivered by all services reflects a focus on smaller
numbers of individuals with higher care needs. This means those with
moderate or low personal care needs and those requiring ``mopping and
shopping'' services are now less likely to receive publicly funded care.
Echoing the views of Burchardt \textit{et al.}. (2015) and Abrahams
\textit{et al.}. (2014), McLeod and Mair (2015) highlight the potential
false economy of this situation -- home care services are likely to
reduce the need for costly emergency admissions to hospital and delay
the requirement for more intensive home care packages - a view also
shared by Audit Scotland (Audit-Scotland, 2012).

\subsection{Resource allocation in Scotland}\label{subsubsec:resources-scot}

Local authorities in Scotland have a statutory obligation to provide
social care to individuals they have assessed as eligible for care
(Audit-Scotland, 2012). Whilst the previous section discussed how
eligibility is determined, this section outlines how funding is
allocated to those that are assessed as eligible for care. The
strategies local authorities have employed to provide services during
budgetary constraint are also discussed.

Local authority funding is provided by the Scottish Government via a
block general revenue grant made up of a number of components in
addition to revenue raised via local taxes and charges (King \emph{et
al.}, 2007; Scottish-Government, 2013). The majority of the
centrally-provided grant is calculated via a formula known as the Grant
Aided Expenditures (GAE) which accounts for over 80\% of the general
revenue grant (Scottish-Government, 2018a). The formula for GAE is
calculated using what is called a ``client group approach'' and is based
on 89 services provided by local authorities (Scottish-Government,
2018a). A national figure for each service is set and each local
authority receives a percentage of that figure based on estimates of the
number of people that use that service (a capitation) and other
secondary indicators affecting needs and/or costs of provision such as
area deprivation or rurality (Smith, 2003; Scottish-Government, 2018a).
For example, funding for primary school teachers is based on the number
of children in primary education (primary indicator) and adjusted to
take into account the percentage of pupils in small schools (secondary
indicator) (Scottish-Government, 2018a).

The use of formulae to allocate public expenditure has potential to
improve efficiency in spending and equity of distribution (Smith, 2003).
Equity of distribution is achieved via the explicit nature of a formula
framework with transparent methodology that can be debated and amended
(Smith, 2003). The formula for the ``green book'' settlement was agreed
with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA)
(Scottish-Government, 2013). However, as King \textit{et al.} (2007)
note, GAE grants to local authorities are estimates of relative, rather
than absolute, spending needs in that area. The ``green book'' reporting
the annual settlement for local authorities in Scotland stresses that
the values allocated for different services are not budgets or targets
and that local authorities are free to spend resources (other than
ring-fenced monies) as they see fit (Scottish-Government, 2018a). In
effect, ``\ldots the capitation payments seek to offer comparable public
sector organisations the opportunity to deliver some average level of
service, assuming average responses to social and economic
circumstances, and an average level of efficiency'' (Smith, 2003, p.
309).

The ``green book'' outlines seven main areas of local authority
expenditure from which the 89 services mentioned above are derived;
Education, Social Work, Roads \& Transport, Leisure \& Recreation,
Cleansing \& Environment, Elections \& Taxation, and Other Services
(Scottish-Government, 2018a). Spending allocation for social care comes
under the social work heading which is subdivided into 23 subcategories
of services. Of these, nine (listed below) are directly related to
social care as defined for the purposes of this thesis; the others being
based on children's services or similar:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item service for home based elderly
\item residential accommodation for the elderly
\item casework and related administration: elderly
\item services for people with disabilities
\item casework and related administration: people with disabilities
\item independent living fund
\item carers support and respite services
\item care home fees
\item personal and nursing care for older people
\end{itemize}

The expenditure for the first three items on this list, as well as
carers support and respite services and care home fees, is calculated
using population weighted indices for each local authority derived from:
the standardised mortality ratio, census data on self-report long-term
illness and people living alone, as well as pension credit data (service
for home based elderly) or council tax data (residential accommodation
for the elderly). Services relevant to people with disabilities and the
independent living fund are calculated depending on the number of people
aged 16-64 in each local authority. Expenditure allocation for personal
and nursing care for older people is derived from formulae calculated in
the Scottish Government Health Directorate Distribution
(Scottish-Government, 2018a).

The GAE formula has been in place for some time (initially outlined in
1992 (Scottish-Government, 2018a)). The more recent issue facing local
authorities in terms of finance has been cuts following the 2008
financial crash. In the financial year 2016/17 the overall grant to
Scottish local authorities was cut in real-terms by 5\% which added to a
cumulative real-term cut of 11\% since 2010/11 (Audit-Scotland, 2016a).
Authorities have been managing this pressure by reducing spending in all
areas of their budgets - with the exception of social work
(Audit-Scotland, 2016a). £3.1 billion was spent on social work by
Scottish local authorities in 2014/15 - an increase of 3\% since 2010/11
and a third of all council spending (Audit-Scotland, 2016c). However,
given the 5\% decrease planned for 2016/17, Audit Scotland (2016a)
warned that social work (and specifically social care) budgets are now
likely to be cut - resulting in a decrease in the quality of service
(Audit-Scotland, 2016c).

Although overall budgets have slightly increased, efficiency savings
have been made by contracting the provision of social care to the
private and voluntary sectors (Audit-Scotland, 2016c). In 2008, over
70\% of home care clients in Scotland received care provided only by a
local authority, in 2017 this figure was less than 50\%. Private and
voluntary sector organisations are now increasingly providing home care
\emph{purchased} by the local authority (Scottish-Government, 2017d).
However, as discussed in Section \ref{subsubsec:eligibility-uk}, savings
have also been made by tightening eligibility criteria with the result
that absolute numbers of individuals receiving care has fallen over the
same period (Audit-Scotland, 2016c).

These budgetary pressures are difficult for local authorities to manage,
but what is the outcome on service users? Using the
``pro-rich/pro-poor'' nomenclature initially used by (Bramley \emph{et
al.}, 2005) (and discussed in Section \ref{subsubsec:theory-resources}),
Gannon \textit{et al.} (2017) investigated the social impact of spending
cuts in Scotland. The report found that the vast majority of local
authority spending is on services that are ``pro-poor'' i.e.~services
that are disproportionately used by people with lower socioeconomic
position. As a result, despite attempts to protect these services, the
cuts to local authority spending have a disproportionate effect on this
societal group. Councils with higher numbers of the most deprived
citizens are having to make the biggest percentage cuts in services
defined as ``very pro-poor'' (e.g.~social work for children and families
or citizen's advice). These findings echoed an earlier report from the
project looking at cuts across the UK as a whole (Hastings \emph{et
al.}, 2015).

Gannon \textit{et al.}'s report (2017) assigns older persons social work
services as ``pro-poor'' along with local authority public transport but
does not distinguish between the two in analysis. It is therefore
difficult to dis-aggregate the specific effect of cuts on social care
from the report particularly as there was an increase in spending
between 2010/11 and 2014/15 (discussed above). Nevertheless, cuts
expected to social care budgets from 2016/17 (Audit-Scotland, 2016a) are
also likely to have a disproportionate effect on those with lower
socioeconomic position.

\subsection{Social theory}\label{subsec:soc-theory}

\subsubsection{Eligibility}\label{subsubsec:eligibility}

\setlength{\epigraphwidth}{0.8\textwidth}
\epigraph{``...the \textit{criteria} under which a given individual is eligible for publicly funded support for long-term care, and for how much support the individual is eligible, and the \textit{processes} involved in selecting from the general population those who receive this support and determining for how much support each person is eligible"}{\textit{[Eleftheriades and Wittenberg, 2013, pp.2}}

As discussed in section \ref{subsec:mm-hi}, the ``inverse care law''
describes how resources and funding does not flow fairly to those most
in need in a primary care setting. This section provides additional
social theory investigating why public resources may not be fairly
distributed in the context of eligibility and allocation for/of social
care discussed above. Two social theories on how eligibility for public
services are determined will be discussed in this subsection:
street-level bureaucracy and candidacy.

The term street-level bureaucracy is generally credited to Michael
Lipsky and his book of the same name (1979), along with its more recent
revision (Lipsky, 2010). The theory investigates the extent to which
front-line public service workers exercise discretion in which
individuals of the general public are eligible to access any given
service - doing so from a position of authority, free from
organisational oversight and unconstrained by organisational policies
(Lipsky, 2010). As a result, street-level bureaucrats control
``\ldots the nature, amount, and quality of benefits and sanctions
provided by their agencies.'' (Lipsky, 2010, p. 13). Using the term,
``street-level'' suggests that the theory is concerned with power, where
it resides, and who wields it (Hupe \emph{et al.}, 2016). Street-level
bureaucrats can be teachers, police officers, nurses, social workers, or
any other worker providing a public service (Hupe \emph{et al.}, 2016)
and their ``\ldots decisions\ldots, the routines they establish, and the
devices they invent to cope with uncertainties and work pressures
effectively \textit{become} the public policies they carry out''
(Lipsky, 2010, p. xiii).

Evans (2010) and Ellis (2011) both provide a critique of street-level
bureaucracy that suggests the theory needs to be augmented to take into
account new structures of public services, particularly in social work,
that place greater autonomy with managers than front-line workers. They
argue that these new structures mean workers who deal face-to-face with
public service users have less discretion about eligibility criteria and
are more likely to have to justify eligibility decisions to senior
members of staff who now wield more power in terms of service access.

Empirically exploring the effects of street-level bureaucracy poses a
number of methodological problems (Hupe \emph{et al.}, 2016). The use of
large sample surveys of public sector workers investigating their views
and how they make decisions is one way (e.g.~Tummers and Bekkers
(2014)). However Lipsky (2010) and Hupe \textit{et al.} (2016) agree
that qualitative interview techniques with public sector workers in
their own workplace is the best way to fully understand how street-level
bureaucracy impacts on front-line services.

In contrast to street-level bureaucracy, ``candidacy'' theory focuses on
the ways in which service recipients influence resource distribution.
The term ``candidacy'' was first used by Dixon-Woods \textit{et al.}
(2005, 2006) to form a concept of how vulnerable individuals identified
themselves as being eligible for a particular health service or
intervention given for particular illnesses or health conditions. The
theory was further explored and augmented by Mackenzie \textit{et al.}
(2013, 2015) in relation to access and utilisation of all public
services as a way to explore concerns about unequal distribution of
uptake.

The theory argues that there are a number of social and cultural factors
that contribute to an individual's interpretation of their eligibility
for a given service and is based on a seven-stage model as shown in
Table \ref{tab:candidacy}

\begin{table}[h]
\rowcolors{2}{white}{gray!10}

\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%

\end{tabular}%
}
\caption{Seven stage model of candidacy}
\label{tab:candidacy}
\end{table}

This is a much broader theory than that of street-level bureaucracy and
focusses on the barriers and enablers individuals face/use when
accessing services. In other respects it is trying to do the same thing
- exploring how front-line interactions shape outcomes. It could be
argued that candidacy includes the concept of street-level bureaucracy
in the third, fifth, and sixth stages of the model shown in Table
\ref{tab:candidacy}. ``Permeability of services'', ``professional
decision making'', and ``offers of and resistance to services'' are
areas where an interface between a service user and service professional
takes place - much like the interactions described by Lipsky.

Investigating candidacy as a theory empirically again appears to be best
served using qualitative methods. The complex and dynamic nature of
candidacy suggests identifying meaningful quantitative measures are
unlikely. Both Dixon-Woods \textit{et al.} (2005, 2006) and Mackenzie
\textit{et al.} (2013, 2015) employed critical interpretive synthesis in
their studies.

Both of the social theories described in this subsection deal with the
concept of eligibility and how, in the case of street-level bureaucracy,
professionals exercise discretion on access to service and, in the case
of candidacy, how service-users identify whether they are eligible and
offer themselves for a service in the first place. Both theories
describe complex interactions between individuals across an eligibility
criteria barrier.

\subsubsection{Resource allocation}\label{subsubsec:theory-resources}

\epigraph{``Almost all public expenditure on the social services in Britain benefits the better off to a greater extent than the poor"}{\textit{[Le Grand, 1982, pp.3]}}

In his seminal book, ``The strategy of equality'', Julian Le Grand
(1982) investigated whether social and economic equality had been
achieved since the introduction of post-war welfare spending. The book
compares the distribution of public expenditure and outcomes across
health, education, housing, and transport. It concludes, as highlighted
in the quote above, that those with higher socioeconomic position
benefited disproportionately from government social services spending
across all sectors. Indeed, ``\ldots there persist substantial
inequalities in public expenditure, in use, in opportunity, in access,
and in outcomes'' (Le Grand, 1982, p. 4).

Criticism of Le Grand's conclusions cites subsequent research that shows
empirical evidence indicating a reduction in inequalities and questions
the assumption that the sole purpose of the welfare state is to achieve
equality (Powell, 1995). More recent research (Bramley and Evans, 2000;
Bramley \emph{et al.}, 2005 cited in; Hastings, 2007; Hastings \emph{et
al.}, 2014) has shown that when comparing distribution of resources at
neighbourhood level (rather than national level) there is higher
spending in less affluent areas. However some service were found to be
``pro-rich'' (education, pensions) and others ``pro-poor'' (parks,
environmental services) (Bramley \emph{et al.}, 2005 cited in; Hastings
\emph{et al.}, 2014). Whether a service is more likely to be used by
more or less affluent citizens is important in terms of resource
allocation - particularly when services are being cut as shown by Gannon
\textit{et al.} (2017) and previously discussed in Section
\ref{subsubsec:resources-scot}.

Understanding why there are differences in resource allocation for
different types of service has led to the investigation of ``middle
class capture'' of services and how it is obtained (Gal, 1998; Matthews
and Hastings, 2013; Hastings \emph{et al.}, 2014). An adapted version of
Gal's (1998) six channel framework of middle class advantage described
by Hastings \emph{et al.} (2014) is shown in Table \ref{tab:gal}.

\label{tab:gal}

\textbackslash end\{table\}

These six ``channels'' conceptualise the modes of how and why welfare
spending in certain areas appears to benefit more affluent groups. In
their study investigating street-cleaning services, Hastings
\textit{et al.} (2014) observed the influence of middle class capture
and some of the channels of advantage described in Table \ref{tab:gal}
suggesting the theories of Le Grand (1982), described above, should not
be discounted.

There has been no research on whether the inverse care law (discussed in
Section \ref{subsec:mm-hi}) is perceptible in social care - a service
delivered, like primary care, in a community setting and also likely to
have an impact on secondary health care use. It has, however, been
suggested that the inverse care law \emph{does} exist for social care
(Oliver, 2018b). The reasoning for this is based on the premise that
local authorities with larger proportions of less affluent residents are
unable to generate the same income as richer local authorities,
resulting in worse service access. This has not been empirically proved
for social care specifically, but Hastings \textit{et al.} (2017) found
that cuts to local authority spending since 2010 do have a
disproportionate effect on the most disadvantaged local authorities.

\subsection{Summary}\label{subsec:access-sc-summary}

There is no agreed standard definition of social care, a term often used
synonymously is long-term care. The boundary between what is health care
and what is social care is often blurry. The definition chosen for this
thesis provided by Colombo \textit{et al.} (2011) encapsulates the wide
number of services that make-up social care including nursing, personal,
equipment, and technological. The definition also identifies that social
care can be provided not only at home, but also in institutions or other
community settings.

Three broad models of social care are seen internationally: universal,
mixed, and means-tested schemes. Within each of these models there are
many different methods of delivery across countries and no easy
comparison identifying differences can be made. It does appear that
universal systems spread the risk of the costs of social care more
equitably among the populations where it is employed. Importantly, every
model of social care involves some user-contribution towards costs.

Eligibility for social care is determined via pre-specified criteria in
all cases. How these criteria are set varies greatly across and within
countries. In UK terms, eligibility criteria are set by local
authorities and have been greatly tightened in recent years as a
response to budgetary constraint. Also observed is the process of
``intensification'' where greater hours of social care are being
delivered to smaller numbers of people with higher needs. This has
potential to erode an important function of social care - preventing
expensive unscheduled health care use.

Eligibility for social care can also be affected by the individual in
need, and those applying the pre-determined criteria. Social theories
regarding this include ``street-level bureaucracy'' and ``candidacy''.
Both theories describe difficulties that may exist in individuals
attempting to access public provided services, the latter in more detail
and including aspects of the former. Both theories are best suited to
being investigated with qualitative methods.

Allocation of resources for social care in Scotland are decided by local
authorities. The monies they receive are dependent on a grant from the
Scottish Government which is calculated via the GAE formula. The GAE
formula allocates money for social care services based on a mixture of
data from each local authority including; mortality and morbidity
ratios, the amount of people living alone, and the ratio of people
paying certain levels of tax or receiving certain benefits. This formula
has been in place for over 20 years and was agreed with COSLA.

Social theories regarding allocation of resources for public service
suggest those with higher socioeconomic position are more likely to
benefit from public spending than their less affluent peers. Empirical
analysis of the theories of: ``The strategy of equality'', ``The inverse
care law'', and ``middle class capture'' all suggest more affluent
groups are better at accessing public services.

There have been significant cuts to local authority budgets across the
UK since 2008. Savings have been made whilst trying to protect
front-line services but current and future cuts are likely to impact
these services. Most local authority spending is on services used by
those from lower socioeconomic positions thus cuts will
disproportionately affect these people. Little is known about how access
to social care differs across socioeconomic strata and between local
authorities. In an age of austerity, the question of whether an inverse
\textit{social} care law exists remains unanswered.

\section{Health and Social Care}\label{sec:hsc-interaction}

As has been shown, multimorbidity and social care are two areas of
increasing policy importance. This section describes literature
concerning the interaction between health and social care services. For
some time it has been internationally recognised that the boundaries
between these services are blurred and that increasing demand means the
sustainability of current funding models is in jeopardy. There is also
the view that effective social care services have the potential to
prevent use of expensive health services. In Scotland, health and social
care services were legally integrated in 2016 with the hope of achieving
this aim. The section firstly provides some context to the policy
background that led to the integration of health and social care.
Secondly, a detailed description of the structural changes that the
legislation implemented is described. Finally, literature investigating
the effectiveness of health and social care integration and the
interaction of these services is reviewed.

\subsection{Context}\label{subsec:policy}

Acknowledging the likelihood of increased demand, the Scottish
Government set up the Christie Commission on the future delivery of
public services in 2010. In its final report (Christie, 2011), the
commission made a number of pertinent observations including:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label={\alph*)}]
\item Increasing demand for public services are due not only to demographic reasons but also because of a failure to tackle inequality
\item Spending on public services is unlikely to return to 2010 levels until 2026
\item Public services in 2010 were fragmented with no coordination and often different services duplicated work
\item Public services had a ``top-down" approach to delivery with institutional and professional needs given precedence over users.
\end{enumerate}

The recommendations of the commission included: better coordination and
integration of public services, empowerment of communities in how
services are structured, reduction in demand for services by focussing
on prevention, and improving the performance and efficiency of services.

These recommendations had profound effects on subsequent policy and
legislation in Scotland, most notably in relation to health and social
care services (Christie, 2011), although this was not the first policy
aimed at improving coordination (Audit-Scotland, 2018b). Previous
policies aiming to increase cooperation between NHS health boards and
local authority provided social care included: the Joint Future Group
(2000), the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act (2002), Community
Health Partnerships {[}2002{]}, and the Integrated Resource Framework
(Ferguson \emph{et al.}, 2012).

The year 2011 also saw the publication of the Scottish Government vision
to achieve sustainable quality in the delivery of healthcare services by
the year 2020 (Scottish-Government, 2011). Echoing some of the Christie
Commission recommendations, the 2020 vision contained a number of
objectives to change the way health and social care services are
delivered including: a focus on prevention and self-management of health
conditions, an expanded role for GPs and primary care, a focus on
reducing hospital stays and providing treatments in a community setting,
improving care for those with multimorbidity, and formally integrating
health and social care services (Audit-Scotland, 2016b).

The inclusion of the last of these objectives - to formally legislate
for the integration of health and social care - was in response to the
fact that that although previous policies had made some progress in
improving co-ordination between services, this had not had a
demonstrable impact on outcomes for service users (Audit-Scotland, 2011,
2015; A Petch, 2012). This was often as a result, among other things, of
different cultures in health and social care organisations
(Audit-Scotland, 2011). The difference in culture is perhaps
understandable given the very different ways health and social care have
been historically funded and delivered.

As previously discussed, health care in Scotland (and the rest of the
UK) is provided via the NHS free at the point of need to all citizens
(Ham \emph{et al.}, 2013). This principal has remained in place despite
many internal changes of structure (with some divergence from other
parts of the UK) (Ham \emph{et al.}, 2013). Front-line services are
delivered by 14 geographically-based health boards (Ham \emph{et al.},
2013). In contrast, provision of social care was the responsibility of
the 32 Scottish local authorities who either provided the services,
purchased provision through third-party private or voluntary
organisations, or gave individuals a budget to purchase provision
themselves (Ham \emph{et al.}, 2013). As discussed in Section
\ref{sec:access-sc}, this service is not universal and depends on a
needs-test against set eligibility criteria. Means-testing is employed
to determine user-contribution to non-personal and non-nursing care
institutional care home costs.

Given such contrasting backgrounds, and most importantly separate silos
of funding sources and budgets, integration of services had many
barriers (Ham \emph{et al.}, 2013). Building on the 2020 vision
(Scottish-Government, 2011) objective of integrating health and social
care, legislation to enact this structural change into law was announced
in 2011. Section \ref{subsec:hsc-integration} describes these changes in
more detail.

\subsection{Health and social care integration}\label{subsec:hsc-integration}

\epigraph{``Our vision is that by 2020 everyone is able to live longer healthier lives at home, or in a homely setting. We will have a healthcare system where we have integrated health and social care, a focus on prevention, anticipation and supported self-management. When hospital treatment is required, and cannot be provided in a community setting, day case treatment will be the norm. Whatever the setting, care will be provided to the highest standards of quality and safety, with the person at the centre of all decisions. There will be a focus on ensuring that people get back into their home or community environment as soon as appropriate, with minimal risk of re-admission."}{\textit{(Scottish Government, 2011, pp.2)}}

The Public Working (Joint Bodies) (Scotland) Act (HM-Government, 2014a)
paved the way for the legal integration of health and social care
services and all integrated authorities had management and structural
plans in place by the Scottish Government's designated deadline of 1st
April 2016. These reforms were seen as the ``\ldots most significant
change to the way we care for and improve the health of our people, in
their communities, since the creation of the NHS'' (Scottish-Government,
2017a).

One of the most important changes this legislation made was that funding
for the designated integrated services were to be provided from a single
budget. In a report investigating future change to health and social
care services in England, the Barker commission noted, ``\ldots moving
to a single budget with a single commissioner is not a sufficient
condition to tackle the myriad problems of integration that face health
and social care. But we believe it is a necessary one'' (Barker, 2014,
p. 9).

Integration was expected to ensure: better outcomes, more efficient use
of resources, reduction in hospital and residential long-term care use,
a shift in care closer to people's homes, and the avoidance of the
consequences of fragmented and uncoordinated care (Burgess, 2012, 2016;
Audit-Scotland, 2015, 2016b, 2018b; Scottish-Government, 2015c, 2016b).
However, despite streamlining of budgets, there remain significant
barriers in achieving these aims (Audit-Scotland, 2015, 2016b).

One of the key principles of the legislation was that health and social
care is delivered under one of two models - the body corporate or lead
agency model. The former sees the delegation of budgets from a health
board and one or more local authorities to an Integrated Joint Board
(IJB), later renamed an Integration Authority (IA) (Audit-Scotland,
2018b). This authority is responsible for the delivery of care and
develops a strategic plan for how services will be implemented
(Scottish-Government, 2015c; Burgess, 2016; Kaehne \emph{et al.}, 2017;
Audit-Scotland, 2018b). The IA consists of representatives from the
health board, local authority/authorities, health professionals, social
work professionals, voluntary sector workers, unpaid carers, and service
users (Audit-Scotland, 2015, 2018b; Burgess, 2016). The full extent of
integrated services delegated to the IA varies from area to area but as
a minimum adult social care services, adult community health services,
and some adult acute health services (particularly those that incur lots
of emergency admissions) are delegated (Scottish-Government, 2015c;
Audit-Scotland, 2015, 2018b; Burgess, 2016; Kaehne \emph{et al.}, 2017).
The IA decides how the delegated budgets will best achieve the aims of
the strategic plan for the area and directs the NHS board and local
authority/authorities to provide services according to this plan
(Audit-Scotland, 2015, 2018b; Kaehne \emph{et al.}, 2017).

Under the lead agency model, a plan is made to divide the delivery of
specific health and social care services to either the NHS board or a
local authority (Scottish-Government, 2015c; Audit-Scotland, 2015,
2018b; Burgess, 2016; Kaehne \emph{et al.}, 2017). Funding for these
services is transferred between the health board and local authority as
agreed in a delivery plan (Audit-Scotland, 2015, 2018b; Kaehne \emph{et
al.}, 2017). The lead agency plan between NHS Highland and Highland
Council is the only one in place in Scotland - all other areas favouring
the body corporate model (Scottish-Government, 2015c; Audit-Scotland,
2015, 2018b; Burgess, 2016; Kaehne \emph{et al.}, 2017). Under this
plan, NHS Highland is responsible for the delivery of all adult health
and social care services, whilst the council takes responsibility for
children's community health and social care services (Burgess, 2016;
Kaehne \emph{et al.}, 2017).

One of the main aims of integration is to reduce unscheduled healthcare
use, in particular unplanned admissions to hospital, which can be an
indicator of a lack of social care support in an area
(Scottish-Government, 2015c; Audit-Scotland, 2015, 2016b, 2018b). There
are other key performance indicators that have been set nationally as a
way to audit the improvements (or lack thereof) made over time. These
are focussed on outcomes on individuals and include self-report of
health and well-being questions from surveys and statistics collected
from routine data on service use (Scottish-Government, 2015a, 2016a;
Kaehne \emph{et al.}, 2017).

In a report published immediately prior to IAs taking control of
services, Audit Scotland (2015) suggested that disagreements over
budgets, poor workforce planning, difficult to understand governance
arrangements, and poor planning around involvement of the charity and
private sectors meant that little improvement was likely to be seen in
2016/17. More recently Audit Scotland has reported that, although some
improvements had been made, the core aims of integrated financial and
strategic planning have not occurred in IAs and that the main barrier to
achieving these aims remained the lack of collaboration at the
institutional level (2018a). This view is shared by Pearson \& Watson
(2018) who interviewed 70 professionals involved in Scottish IAs, and
also concluded that the potential gains of integration are not yet being
realised.

\subsection{Research on health and social care interaction}\label{subsec:research}

\epigraph{``There is tentative evidence that financial integration can be beneficial. However, robust evidence for improved health outcomes or cost savings is lacking"}{\textit{(Weatherly \textit{et al.}, 2010 pp. 3)}}

The large scale structural change in health and social care services
seen in Scotland and further afield is built on the expectation that
more social care provision can help reduce unplanned health care use.
Although intuitive, there is very little robust evidence to suggest that
integration strategies have this desired outcome (Stewart \emph{et al.},
2003; Petch, 2009; Weatherly \emph{et al.}, 2010; Burgess, 2012; A
Petch, 2012; Robson, 2013; Damery \emph{et al.}, 2016; Cameron, 2016;
Kaehne \emph{et al.}, 2017). Much research has been conducted on the
\textit{structural} elements of health and social care integration with
little emphasis on \textit{outcomes} for service users (A. Petch, 2012).
There has also been little attention paid to those who deliver
front-line services, indeed, ``.. a preoccupation with the process and
mechanisms of joint working has diverted attention away from the central
role played by the professions, who appear sceptical of the aims of
these initiatives and distrustful of their professional colleagues''
(Cameron, 2016, p. 12).

The lack of evidence around outcomes may be partially due to the
difficulty in collecting data that can measure the interaction between
health and social care services. A report for the OECD (2013)
highlighted the paucity of good data regarding social care, even in
countries known to have good data resources. The report also suggests
that use of routine administrative data may be a useful tool in
addressing this lack of evidence (OECD/EU, 2013). Indeed, a number of
studies have now been published using administrative data. Spiers
\textit{et al.} (2018) recently produced a systematic review of evidence
focussing on the effect of any form of social care use on healthcare
outcomes with all of the included studies utilising administrative data.

Of the twelve studies included in the systematic review, only seven were
graded to be of ``good'' quality and high heterogeneity made comparison
of studies problematic (Spiers \emph{et al.}, 2018). Where studies
\emph{did} report similar outcome and exposure measures, higher spending
on social care or provision of nursing and residential care showed
associations with reduced hospital admissions, delayed discharges,
length of hospital stay, and secondary health care spending.

It is important to note, however, that many of the included studies in
this review relied on aggregate data at either local authority or
national level and were not linked at the individual level. Furthermore,
perusal of supplementary materials from the paper indicates 24 studies
investigating the outcome of interest, twice the included number, were
excluded because social care components could not be isolated for
synthesised statistical analysis. It could be argued that a different
analytical approach may have been warranted in these circumstances to
include this body of evidence.

A small number of studies have been published in the last decade using
linked-administrative data to look specifically at interactions between
health and social care services. Interestingly, Porter \textit{et al.}
(2016) and Porter (no date), using Welsh data, reported that aggregate
statistics of social care use and emergency admission to hospital showed
no correlation. However, when analysing individual-level linked
administrative data, those that received social care before an emergency
admission episode were more likely to have fewer subsequent admissions
with shorter lengths of stay than those that received social care only
after an admission. The study period covered six years of data for
adults over the age of 65. The linked data component utilised data from
one local authority area of Wales. The fact only a conference abstract
has been published from this important research is regrettable and
caution, due to the lack of peer-review, should be applied to the
findings.

One published review linking individual-level data of over 75s from four
local authority areas in England (n=133,055) found that those receiving
social care were also likely to have higher hospital use (Bardsley
\emph{et al.}, 2012). In addition, the study found that those living in
a care home or nursing home had less hospital use than those receiving
intense (measured by cost) home care services. The convenience sample
used in the study was skewed towards areas in the middle of the
distribution of deprived areas which limits the generalisability of the
findings. Furthermore, data from one financial year was analysed in
descriptive comparisons. No consideration of the effect of social care
on subsequent hospital use, or vice versa, is made. A final limitation
of the study is that it included only local authority provided social
care. As described in Section, \ref{subsubsec:eligibility-uk}, only
those with few financial assets are eligible for these services; the
potential confounding effect of low socioeconomic position on hospital
use is not appraised in the study. Nevertheless, empirical evidence that
those that use social care also have high levels of hospital use is
novel in the UK, contradicts evidence from aggregate data in Spiers
\emph{et al's} (2018) systematic review, and warrants further
investigation.

The finding that social care users also consume a higher proportion of
secondary care has previously been described in a Swedish paper.
Condelius \textit{et al.} (2008) included the \textasciitilde5000
individuals over 65 from four municipal areas (analogous to local
authorities) who had at least one hospital discharge over a one-year
period. They found that those who had the most secondary care use were
more likely to have high multimorbidity and receive municipal provided
social care. This again contradicts the findings of Spiers \emph{et al}
(2018). In this study, those coded as receiving social care were
recorded as doing so in the second month (February) of the study year.
Therefore, those commencing social care services after this date were
misclassified in analysis.

Traditionally, research on the interaction between health and social
care has been limited by the paucity of good data on social care
receipt. However, increasing numbers of studies are being published
utilising the potential of administrative records. Spiers
\textit{et al.'s} (2018) systematic review is a welcome addition to the
debate on the interaction between health and social care services.
However, they rightly point out the difficulty in synthesising evidence
from highly heterogeneous studies. Differences in the systems of health
and social care, data types, outcomes, and analysis techniques make it
impossible to draw robust conclusions from these studies. Although
Spiers \textit{et al.} remark, ``\ldots the overall direction of
evidence was consistent'', the limitations of the data, including
paucity of home care data and reliance on aggregate measures, means
these results should be interpreted with caution. Studies that have
linked data at an individual level paint a difference picture of health
and social care interaction. Findings in the UK and Sweden suggest
individuals receiving social care are also more likely to utilise
secondary care services. These studies are limited by their small sample
sizes which raise questions about the generalisability of their
findings. All these studies demonstrate, however, that linking
administrative data sources is a feasible option for this type of
research and that these techniques may be able to improve understanding
of the interaction between health and social care services.

\subsection{Summary}\label{subsec:hsc-interaction-summary}

Public policy in Scotland has been edging towards greater integration of
health and social care services since the devolved Scottish Parliament
was set-up in 1997. A lack of progress in shifting care from secondary
to community settings through policy alone prompted legislation to
formalise the integration of these services - a law which came into
effect on the 1st April 2016.

Almost all areas of Scotland have opted to employ a body-corporate model
of integration where health boards and local authorities devolve
responsibility and budgets to an Integrated Authority that sets local
priorities and directs how services will be delivered. Early indications
suggest IAs have not yet overcome governance, budgetary, or workforce
issues to make any improvements in nationally set outcome indicators.

Very little research has been conducted into the interaction of health
and social care services at the user level. Most studies and reports
focus on the structural implications of integrating care instead. Novel
techniques involving the linkage of administrative data sources at the
individual-level are a feasible way of filling the gap in knowledge
about the interaction of these services and the impacts they have on
service-users. However, use of aggregate data may not provide the most
accurate assessment of any interaction. A small number of studies
linking data at an individual level suggest users of social care may
also be high secondary care users although the quality of evidence is
poor. Large scale linkages have the potential to add important evidence
regarding the interaction between health and social care.

\newpage
\section{Administrative Data Linkage}\label{sec:data-linkage}

Administrative data linkage offers an excellent opportunity to
investigate the aims set out for this thesis. As has been shown, this
technique has been increasingly used in recent years to investigate
interactions between health and social care services. Absent from much
of this research, however, is investigation of the relationship between
multimorbidity and social care services.

Increased availability of administrative data means the potential for
researching policy-relevant questions is rapidly growing (Connelly
\emph{et al.}, 2016). There are, however, many considerations to take
into account compared to orthodox research data collection -
particularly as the data is collected for reasons other than research
(Connelly \emph{et al.}, 2016). This section briefly discusses the
benefits and drawbacks of administrative data research before providing
an overview of data resources relevant to the specific aims of this
thesis.

\subsection{Context}

\epigraph{Record linkage refers to a merging that brings together information from two or more sources of data with the object of consolidating facts concerning an individual or an event that are not available in any separate record.}{\textit{[OECD, 2006]}}

Administrative data is data that is generated when individuals use a
service of some description. Often in research terms, and exclusively in
this thesis, administrative data refers to data generated by the use of
\textit{public} services (Pavis and Morris, 2015; Mazzali and Duca,
2015; Connelly \emph{et al.}, 2016) or in governmental registers such as
a census or records of births, deaths, and marriages (Connelly \emph{et
al.}, 2016). As the above definition outlines, record linkage involves
joining data about individuals from two or more administrative databases
together (Fleming \emph{et al.}, 2012; Harron, 2016) and is being
increasingly used in social science research (Atherton \emph{et al.},
2015; Bell \emph{et al.}, 2016).

Using administrative data for research purposes has a number of
advantages and disadvantages. The most obvious drawback is that the data
is not collected for research purposes and as such may lack specific
information relevant to a researcher's line of inquiry (Mazzali and
Duca, 2015). This also reduces the ability of a study to adjust for all
potential confounding variables, decreasing the ability to make causal
inferences from analyses (Mazzali and Duca, 2015). Furthermore, there is
the potential for ambiguity about the coding of variables in a database
and what each code represents (Mazzali and Duca, 2015; Atherton \emph{et
al.}, 2015; Walesby \emph{et al.}, 2017) which means specialist
knowledge of the database and collection methods are required (Mazzali
and Duca, 2015). Administrative databases also have the potential to
contain data of questionable quality and high levels of missing data
(van-Walraven and Austin, 2012; Hashimoto \emph{et al.}, 2014; Harron
\emph{et al.}, 2017). Data can be missing for the same reasons as seen
in other forms of research but, in addition, individuals may also be
missing due to failure to interact with a service or because
insufficient information was available to accurately match records
during the data-linkage process (Harron \emph{et al.}, 2017).
Administrative databases are also likely to be less-structured and
complex than collected observational surveys, and therefore will require
extensive data cleaning and management in advance of substantive
analysis (Connelly \emph{et al.}, 2016).

Advantages of administrative databases are that they enable large, often
population sized, samples because they are generated from service use
(Mazzali and Duca, 2015; Pavis and Morris, 2015; Walesby \emph{et al.},
2017). This characteristic also reduces the potential for sampling bias
(Mazzali and Duca, 2015). Where whole-populations are included in a
cohort this problem disappears altogether (sometimes referred to as
\textit{n} = \textit{all} studies (Connelly \emph{et al.}, 2016)). Such
cohorts enable research of sub-samples or rare-events where the
statistical power of traditional surveys would not be robust enough to
form firm conclusions (Connelly \emph{et al.}, 2016). Well maintained
administrative data can offer information over long periods of time
including very recent data (Pavis and Morris, 2015). This can make
inferences from research findings more robust with excellent levels of
external validity without the high cost traditional observational
studies might incur (Mazzali and Duca, 2015; Harron \emph{et al.},
2017).

Perhaps the greatest advantage of administrative data research is the
potential to link databases from a number of sources which can offer
insights into how services interact (Mazzali and Duca, 2015; Atherton
\emph{et al.}, 2015; Connelly \emph{et al.}, 2016; Walesby \emph{et
al.}, 2017). However, linkage of data from disparate sources raises
legal and ethical questions of privacy and consent. To overcome these
concerns in the UK, infrastructure have been put in place to enable
researchers to access sensitive data whilst maintaining individual
privacy and legal compliance with data processing. A full description of
this infrastructure in Scotland is provided by Pavis \& Morris (2015)
and the steps taken for this thesis are comprehensively covered in
Chapter \ref{ch:data}. In general, approvals and review processes
enabling access to linked administrative data aim to incorporate the
``Five Safes'' framework (Desai \emph{et al.}, 2016) summarised in Table
\ref{tab:litrv-5safes}.

\end{table}

There are two main methods of linking data from disparate sources;
deterministic matching and probabilistic matching (Fleming \emph{et
al.}, 2012; Harron, 2016; Doidge and Harron, 2018). Where differing
datasets possess common unique identifiers, deterministic matching
simply links data using this identifier. Probabilistic matching
methodology can be employed in the absence of a common unique identifier
(Fleming \emph{et al.}, 2012; Harron, 2016; Doidge and Harron, 2018).
Using this method, a probability of two records matching correctly is
calculated based on how well the records match based on a set of common
partial identifiers such as name, date-of-birth, and postcode (Fleming
\emph{et al.}, 2012; Harron, 2016; Doidge and Harron, 2018). An
important consideration when using probabilistic linkage is making an
assessment of false-positive match rates (Fleming \emph{et al.}, 2012;
Harron, 2016; Doidge and Harron, 2018). There are three main strategies
to assist with this assessment: measuring error using ``gold-standard''
data (such as a validated external datasets), sensitivity analyses
(comparing results across differing linkage parameters), and comparing
linked and unlinked data according to characteristics (such as
sociodemographic subgroups) (Harron, 2016).

Recent developments in computing power and acknowledgement of the
potential value of linking administrative data has seen an increase in
the use of these techniques internationally (Lyons \emph{et al.}, 2009,
2014). Scotland is home to some of the best administrative databases in
the world (Pavis and Morris, 2015). This is particularly due to the
high-quality of health datasets that have been collected and maintained
for over 40 years (Fleming \emph{et al.}, 2012; Pavis and Morris, 2015).
Whilst linkage of differing health datasets has become common over this
period, new cross-sectoral linkages are beginning to emerge such as
health and educational data (Wood \emph{et al.}, 2013), and health and
social care data (Witham \emph{et al.}, 2015). These cross-sectoral
linkages are providing new insights that have the potential to have
lasting impact on policy and provision of services (Pavis and Morris,
2015; Atherton \emph{et al.}, 2015).

\subsection{Data sources in Scotland}\label{subsec-litrv-linkage-sources}

The first aim of this PhD project was to identify what sources of
administrative social care data were available in Scotland and assess
their suitability for research purposes. Ideally, given the other aims
of identifying the relationship of multimorbidity with social care use,
data that could be linked at a population level was desired. Whilst
social care data is collected by all 32 local authorities, obtaining
information from each of these authorities (including associated Data
Sharing Agreements (DSAs)), and then linking to health data was, from a
logistical point of view, impossible to achieve during the lifetime of a
PhD; and perhaps impossible to achieve \emph{at all}. This meant linking
data from a smaller number of councils seemed like the most likely route
to achieve the project aims. However, this raised the question of
whether comparisons would be possible across different IT systems, and
still contained the logistic burden of multiple DSAs.

One alternative source of social care data, the Social Care Survey (SCS)
(Scottish-Government, 2017e), offered the only possibility of overcoming
these problems. The SCS is collected annually by the Scottish Government
and had, since 2010, required this information at an individual-level.
Returns from all local authorities are a statutory requirement and are
received in a standardised format thus providing a national picture of
social care use. However, the SCS does not contain an identifier that
could be used to deterministically link to healthcare records.

Following meetings with Scottish Government (Health and Social Care
Analysis Division (HSCAD)) analysts and other interested stakeholders,
HSCAD commissioned probabilistic matching of SCS records to the National
Records of Scotland (NRS) population spine in August 2016. This indexing
exercise (more fully described in Section \ref{sec:linkage}) would match
SCS records to Community Health Index (CHI) numbers thus facilitating
linkage to NHS health resources and was completed in July 2017. The
commissioning of this work allowed the approvals process to begin and
specific research questions to be formulated.

One potential issue with the coverage of the SCS remained. Many
variables within the survey requested data on service use during a
pre-specified census week. This means that the SCS does not capture all
individuals who receive social care in any given financial year. No
indication of the proportion of social care captured by the SCS in
relation to the full financial year existed. In order to quantify this,
a separate project was conducted for this thesis to obtain \emph{all}
social care data from one local authority area. A fuller description of
the justification for, and the results of, this process are presented in
Chapter \ref{ch:renfrew}.

With the process of obtaining suitable social care data underway,
attention turned to the health data sources required to enable analysis
of the research questions. As described in Section \ref{sec:mm},
definition and measurements of multimorbidity are numerous. A seminal
study on multimorbidity conducted from routine records in Scotland
(Barnett \emph{et al.}, 2012) contained a measurement of multimorbidity
as a count of conditions from a list of 40. This appeared to offer the
best method for the aims of the thesis. However, in order to recreate
this measure, data from primary care sources would need to be accessed
and then linked to social care and other health data sources - the
Barnett \textit{et al.} (2012) study did not involve data linkage.

Primary care data has historically been difficult to access in Scotland
for linkage projects. New software for the extraction of primary care
data was not available when data requests were being made for this
thesis and, to date, permitted access to it does not include
multimorbidity status (ISD, 2019a). This meant alternative sources of
morbidity data had to be considered. These included Scottish Morbidity
Record (SMR) sources. However, these only capture morbidity data of
individuals who interact with secondary health care services. As the
thesis aimed to assess the multimorbidity status of social care users in
the community, reliance on secondary health care sources would not be
satisfactory. The only alternative was to rely on a proxy measurement of
multimorbidity.

As described in Section \ref{subsec:mm-measures}, counts of prescribed
medicines have been used in previous research as a multimorbidity proxy
and perform favourably compared to other measures in predicting
mortality and health care use. Linking the Scottish Prescribing
Information System (PIS) (Alvarez-Madrazo \emph{et al.}, 2016) to social
care and other health data resources (via the CHI number) would allow a
proxy measurement of multimorbidity to be created for all individuals in
the study cohort.

The second research question was to assess the relationships between
multimorbidity, social care, and unscheduled healthcare use. Browsing
NHS Scotland Information Services Division (ISD) National Data Catalogue
(ISD, 2019b) revealed the existence of the Urgent Care Data Mart (UCD)
(ISD, 2017b) which contained multiple variables relevant to unscheduled
care including A \& E attendance, unplanned hospital admission, and GP
out-of-hours services - all linkable to other sources via the CHI
number.

A full description of these data sources, the variables contained within
that were requested, and the process of linkage and analysis are
provided in Chapter \ref{ch:data}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:lit-review-conclusion}

This literature review has covered four broad and differing, but linked,
topics. Population ageing is resulting in increasing prevalence of
multimorbidity which in turn results in higher demand for health and
social care services. As a concept, multimorbidity is more complex than
may be at first presumed and has suffered from ambiguity in terms of
definition. There are many ways of measuring multimorbidity for research
purposes but in some cases simple counts of diseases or medicines can
provide comparable results to more complex methods. The link between
multimorbidity and social care has not been empirically researched.
Given the intuitive relationship between them, it is easy to justify
research of this nature.

Internationally, access to social care varies significantly and is
influenced in two main ways: allocation of resources to providers of
social care and how these providers distribute services within local
areas. Eligibility criteria are the main means of how services are
rationed in the UK. As demands on social care services have increased,
budgets in the UK and Scotland have been drastically cut. Research on
all local authority spending suggests the costs of these cuts have
fallen disproportionately on those of lower socioeconomic position.
Whether this is also true of social care in particular is unknown. Given
evidence of the inverse care law in health care receipt, identifying the
effect of reduced social care provision on individuals and health
service use is of high policy interest.

Despite lack of formal evidence, new models of service delivery have
been sought by governments. In Scotland, the legislative integration of
health and social care services has been implemented with the dual aims
of increasing efficiency \emph{and} quality of service. Individuals with
multimorbidity are high users of health care (and potentially social
care) and are likely to be able to benefit most if integration achieves
its aims.

Intuitively, social care can prevent unplanned used of unscheduled
health care services but there is little evidence that suggests this is
the case. Lack of data, particularly on home care, has made it difficult
to understand the interaction between these services although recent
research suggests receipt of social care may be associated with higher
use of secondary care services.

Routinely collected administrative data, along with new methods of
linking records across sectors offer the best opportunity to address
this lack of evidence. Advances have been made, in terms of
infrastructure and methodology, that enable investigation of difficult
questions (such as those raised by this review) whilst maintaining data
privacy and compliance with legislation. There remain, however,
difficulties with this approach.

Data sources available make it difficult to measure multimorbidity as
per recommended definitions and proxy measurements are often all that
are available to researchers. Routinely collected social care data has
never been used for research in a Scottish context. Whilst it is
exciting the opportunity to do so has now arisen, careful consideration
of the quality and coverage of this data is important before inferences
are made from analyses derived from it.

\chapter{Methods}\label{ch:data}
\thispagestyle{empty}

This chapter outlines the process of obtaining administrative data and
the analysis methods used to answer the thesis research questions. There
are six sections. Firstly, a detailed description of the strict
information governance protocols required including: the infrastructure
used, the approvals process, and the legal framework enabling the
research to take place is provided. Secondly, a thorough description of
the data sources used in analysis outlining: their source, reasons for
collection, and any known quality issues is presented. In the third
section, the process and results of probabilistically matching personal
identifiers from the Social Care Survey to a research population spine
is described. This process enabled the linkage of social and health care
data sources and was conducted by an analyst from the National Records
for Scotland. The fourth section describes how the study cohort was
created including the data wrangling procedures necessary to join
together data from disparate sources. The penultimate section outlines
the statistical methods applied to the data in order to answer the
thesis research questions. Finally, an illustrated timeline depicting
the major stages of the overall project is displayed with a brief
description.

\section{Information Governance}\label{sec:ig}

Confidentiality of data subjects is an important consideration in any
data linkage project. The benefits of administrative data linkage,
outlined in Section \ref{sec:data-linkage}, are dependent on research
being conducted in a legally and ethically competent fashion. Whilst
full anonymisation would be an effective way to protect the
confidentiality of data subjects, it is almost impossible to achieve
this with individual-level data suitable for research purposes (Harron
\emph{et al.}, 2017).

As an alternative, a process involving robust approvals review,
researcher training with associated responsibilities and sanctions,
pseudonymisation of identifying information, and safe haven settings are
used to preserve data subject confidentiality (Harron \emph{et al.},
2017). This section outlines how this process was applied for the
purposes of the data linkage completed in this thesis. Firstly, the
various organisations that provide the infrastructure that enabled the
data linkage to take place are briefly described. An overview of the
various approvals and ethical panels is then provided, followed by the
legal framework which enabled data processing to take place with a brief
description of how confidentiality is maintained during the linkage
process.

\subsection{Infrastructure}\label{subsec:infrastructure}

\subsubsection{Scottish Informatics and Linkage Collaboration}\label{subsec:silc}

The Scottish Informatics and Linkage Collaboration (SILC) is an umbrella
term for a number of support services that are available to individuals
wishing to conduct research using linked administrative data (SILC,
2017c). Services include computing resources (provided by the University
of Edinburgh), research and project coordination advice (provided by the
electronic Data Research and Innovation Service (eDRIS)), and an
indexing service (provided by the National Records of Scotland (NRS))
(SILC, 2017c). SILC currently has three partner institutions; the
Administrative Data Research Centres (ADRC), the Farr Institute, and the
Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC) (SILC, 2017c).

\subsubsection{Urban Big Data Centre}\label{subsec:ubdc}

Funding for this PhD was provided by the Scottish Government and the
Economic \& Social Research Council (ESRC). The bid for funding was won
by UBDC which is based within the University of Glasgow. UBDC is a
research group also funded by the ESRC and brings together data
scientists and social scientists with research interests relevant to
urban living (UBDC, 2017b).

The linkage project described in this thesis was completed with the
assistance of UBDC's controlled data service. This service helps
researchers to access personal data that exists in administrative
databases (UBDC, 2017a). In addition to a vigorous approval process,
access to data is tightly controlled via safe haven IT architecture
which monitors use of data and output of analyses to ensure individual
anonymity is maintained (UBDC, 2017a). UBDC arranges access to the safe
haven environment though liaison with eDRIS, provided by the Information
Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland (NSS) under
the auspices of SILC. A more detailed description of the safe haven is
given in Section \ref{subsec:safe-haven}.

\subsubsection{electronic Data and Research Innovation Service}\label{subsec:edris}

ISD is a subdivision of NHS NSS (ISD, 2010b). NSS is a national NHS
board in its own right and works with the other NHS boards, particularly
the 14 geographic health boards, to provide centralised services such
as: procurement, legal support, IT, and public health intelligence (NSS,
no date). As a division of NSS, ISD provides, among other things,
support for the latter two of these services (ISD, 2010b). This includes
administering the large number of databases containing information on
health service use in Scotland varying from maternity \& births, to
cancer services (ISD, 2010b). ISD held databases used in this thesis,
the Prescribing Information System and Unscheduled Care Data Mart, are
described more fully in sections \ref{subsec:source-pis} and
\ref{subsec:source-ucd}.

eDRIS is part of ISD and provides services under SILC (SILC, 2017b). It
is detailed specifically with assisting research using health
administrative datasets. Researchers using the eDRIS service have a
named research assistant who provides advice on: data sources, study
design, the information governance approvals system, access to the safe
haven environment, and review of analysis outputs to ensure disclosive
information cannot be inferred (ISD, 2010b).

\subsubsection{National Records of Scotland}\label{subsec:nrs}

NRS collects and maintains information about the people of Scotland
including births, deaths, and marriages (NRS, 2017). In addition to
producing annual reports and population estimates, NRS provides the
indexing service under SILC which enables anonymous linking of
administrative databases as a Trusted Third Party. This is made possible
using an indexing spine which is based on the NHS Central Register
(NHSCR) and held by NRS (NRS, 2018a). This is described more fully in
Section \ref{sec:linkage}.

\subsubsection{Health and Social Care Analysis Division}\label{subsec:asd}

The Health and Social Care Analysis Division (HSCAD) is a division
within the Scottish Government that provides statistic, economic, and
research evidence to inform policy making in this area
(Scottish-Government, 2017b). It is one of many Analytical Service
Divisions (ASD) that provide analytical support, advice, and briefing to
the government. HSCAD creates reports and publications in a number of
key areas including: social care, care homes, and mental health and is
responsible for collecting and publishing the Social Care Survey (SCS)
described in Section \ref{subsec:source-sc}.

\subsection{Approvals}\label{subsec:data-approvals}

As described above, one of the ways in which data subject
confidentiality is maintained in data linkage projects is through a
rigorous and robust approvals process. Three separate approvals were
required for the purposes of data linkage in this thesis.

\subsubsection{Research Approvals Committee}\label{subsec:rac}

Data linkage for the project was facilitated by UBDC's controlled data
service. In order to utilise this service, the research proposal
required approval from the UBDC Research Approvals Committee (RAC). A
full list of RAC members is available on-line (UBDC, 2017a). This
committee is independent of UBDC and approves the use of funds and
infrastructure in the centre and includes a lay member of the public
(UBDC, 2017a). An application to use the controlled data service is
judged on its academic merit, public benefit, skill of research team,
and alignment with UBDC aims before being approved (UBDC, 2017c).

\subsubsection{Ethics}\label{subsec:ethics}

Ethical approval for data analysis was sought and gained from the
University of Glasgow College of Social Sciences Research Ethics
Committee (CoSS REC). A blanket ethical approval, obtained by eDRIS from
the NHS East of Scotland REC, covers research that uses NHS Health data,
does not involve direct contact with data subjects, has peer-review
approval, stores data in the national safe haven, and is conducted by
research teams based in the UK (ISD, 2010a). The main linkage project
therefore only required further approval from CoSS REC to cover the
non-health related data (i.e.~the Social Care Survey).

\subsubsection{Public Benefit and Privacy Panel for Health \& Social Care}\label{subsec:pbpp}

In addition to RAC and College ethical approval, the main thesis project
also required clearance from the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel for
Health \& Social Care (PBPP). This was because data from NHS sources
were being used. The PBPP acts as a decision making body with delegated
responsibility from NHS Scotland Chief Executive Officers and the
Registrar General (Scottish-Government, no date). Using terms of
reference and guiding principles, the panel adjudicates whether research
projects using administrative data generated by the NHS in Scotland can
be used for research purposes. The panel ensures that the basis for
disclosing data has a clear public benefit and ensures the legal
framework for accessing and processing data is sound.

The approval for the project was based on a ``create-and-destroy''
model, whereby the data to be used for research purposes was linked
specifically for the analyses articulated in the PBPP application. The
linked data is held in a safe haven environment (Section
\ref{subsec:safe-haven}) for a pre-specified period of time before being
permanently destroyed. In the case of the main PhD project the duration
was set at three years with an archive period of a further five years in
case of queries relating to analyses/publication.

The approval letter for the main thesis project is shown in Appendix A.
A full description of data processing including its legal basis is
presented in Section \ref{subsec:dat-process}.

\subsection{Data processing}\label{subsec:dat-process}

\subsubsection{Legal framework}\label{subsec:dat-legal}

The permissions and linkage of data for this project were completed in
advance of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) coming into effect in May 2018. The information governance was
informed by antecedent laws including the Data Protection Act (DPA)
(1998). However, as the study period was known to overlap with the
implementation of GDPR, all legal documentation was completed to ensure
compliance with the incoming regulation.

Data sharing and processing can be completed without consent of data
subjects as long as certain criteria, explicitly named in legislation,
are met (Bell \emph{et al.}, 2016). For the purposes of this thesis fair
processing of data was completed, without consent, in accordance with
three legislative paragraphs:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Schedule 2:(6) of the DPA.
\begin{quotation} \begin{enumerate} \item The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.\end{enumerate} \end{quotation}

\item Schedule 3:(8) of the DPA (emphasis added)
\begin{quotation} \begin{enumerate}
\item The processing is necessary for medical purposes and is undertaken by 
\begin{enumerate}
\item a health professional, or 
\item a person who in the circumstances owes a duty of confidentiality which is equivalent to that which would arise if that person were a health professional.
\end{enumerate}
\item In this paragraph “medical purposes” includes the purposes of preventative medicine, medical diagnosis, \emph{medical research}, the provision of care and treatment \emph{and the management of healthcare services}
\end{enumerate}\end{quotation}

\item Paragraph 9 of the Data Protection (Processing of Personal Data Order 2000 (SI 2000 No.417)).
\begin{quotation} The project has clear and substantial public interest in the information it will provide to inform the delivery of public services. The data processing is necessary to enable this research to take place. The project does not support measures of analysis with respect to any individual. Finally, the project will not cause any substantial damage or distress to any individual. \end{quotation}

\end{itemize}

Lawful processing of data for the purposes of the project is in
accordance with a further two legal acts:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.
\begin{quotation} 8 Research \begin{enumerate}
\item The Secretary of State may conduct or assist other persons in conducting research into any matter connected with his functions or the functions of local authorities in relation to social welfare, and with the activities of voluntary organisations connected with those functions.
\item Any local authority may conduct or assist other persons in conducting research into any matter connected with their functions in relation to social welfare.
\item The Secretary of State and any local authority may make financial assistance available in connection with any research which they may conduct or which they may assist other persons in conducting under the provisions of this section.
\end{enumerate} \end{quotation}
\item National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978
\begin{quotation} 47 Education and research facilities. (2) Without prejudice to the general powers and duties conferred or imposed on the Secretary of State under the Scottish Board of Health Act 1919, the Secretary of State may conduct, or assist by grants or otherwise any person to conduct, research into any matters relating to the causation, prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness, or into such other matters relating to the health service as he thinks fit.
\end{quotation}
\end{itemize}

Information governance for the project was also informed by the
``Guiding Principles for Data Linkage'' report produced by the Scottish
Government (2012). These guidelines, themselves informed by legislation
such as the DPA, highlight the importance of public interest,
transparency, and privacy when conducting data linkage projects with
publicly held data sets.

In order to preserve anonymity whilst linking administrative data from
different agencies, a method known as ``linkage using a separation of
functions'' is employed (Pavis and Morris, 2015; Harron, 2016). This
process involves the use of a Trusted Third Party (TTP) to process
non-anonymised information in order to link more than one dataset
together. The TTP receives personal information (e.g.~names, addresses
and dates-of-birth) from the data controllers of the administrative
datasets to be used and creates index ``keys'' to send back to the data
controllers to attach to their data (Pavis and Morris, 2015; Harron,
2016). The TTP creates a lookup table of index ``keys'' relevant to each
dataset and sends these to a linkage agent. The linkage agent receives
data from the data controllers \textit{without} personal information and
links them together using the ``keys'' created by the TTP and makes this
available to a researcher in a secure environment (Pavis and Morris,
2015; Harron, 2016). This process means the TTP receives lots of
personal information but no other information, the researcher has access
to information relevant to their study but no personal information, and
the data controllers share information about individuals in their
datasets without compromising anonymity and without seeing data from
each other's databases (SILC, 2017a). An illustration of this process in
the Scottish context using a linkage between NHS and education data is
provided by Pavis \& Morris (2015) and reproduced in Figure
\ref{fig:methods-sep-funcs}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/chapter-methods/sep-of-funcs.pdf}
    \caption{Separation of functions}
    \label{fig:methods-sep-funcs}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Safe haven environment}\label{subsec:safe-haven}

Another integral part of ensuring the confidentiality of data subjects
within large, linked administrative data is by holding such data in a
safe haven environment (Harron \emph{et al.}, 2017). As described in
Section \ref{subsec:ubdc}, access to data for this thesis was
administered via UBDC's controlled data service and further liaison with
eDRIS to enable use of the NSS National safe haven. All data shared for
the purposes of the thesis was transferred by data controllers to the
safe haven by secure file transfer protocol.

The safe haven enables secure data storage and access via a Virtual
Private Network (VPN) connection with strict access control. This
environment does not enable external access of any kind i.e.~internet or
saving \& printing facilities (ISD, 2010c). In order to retrieve output
of analyses, work was submitted for statistical disclosure control which
was conducted by eDRIS employees. This process ensures that data taken
out of the safe haven cannot be used, either on its own or by being
combined with other data, to breach the privacy of any individual (ISD,
2010c; Harron \emph{et al.}, 2017). A full guide to statistical
disclosure control is provided by Lothian \& Ritchie (2017).

\subsubsection{Data sharing agreement}\label{subsec:dsa}

For the purposes of the main linkage project, a three-way data sharing
agreement (DSA) between the University of Glasgow, NHS National Services
Scotland, and Scottish Ministers (Scottish Government) was signed. This
detailed the purpose of data sharing, as well as the transfer,
protection, and security of data. The roles and responsibilities of each
organisation in relation to relevant data protection legislation are
clearly detailed in the DSA.

\section{Data sources for linkage}\label{sec:sources}

Research conducted with administrative data requires a thorough
description of databases used (van-Walraven and Austin, 2012). This
should include a description of the purpose of the data collection and
the methods employed to collect data. This enables appraisal of any
potential biases that may exist within the databases (van-Walraven and
Austin, 2012; Mazzali and Duca, 2015). There are 4 main sources of data
used in the main analyses of this thesis: the Social Care Survey, the
National Records of Scotland population spine and death records, the
Prescribing Information System, and the Unscheduled Care Data Mart. Each
of these are described in more detail below.

\subsection{Social Care Survey}\label{subsec:source-sc}

The Social Care Survey (SCS) is collected annually by HSCAD for the
Scottish Government to provide descriptive statistics of the amounts of
social care delivered by each of Scotland's 32 local authorities
(Scottish-Government, 2017e). Results are collated and published
annually by HSCAD in the ``Social Care Services, Scotland'' report
(Scottish-Government, 2017e). The SCS reports provide an overview of
social care services for the public and policy makers. In addition,
certain measures captured by the SCS are used in funding formulae to
calculate allocation of resources to each local authority (e.g.~number
of people receiving home care) (Scottish-Government, 2018a).

All 32 Scottish local authorities collect information on social care as
part of their management systems (Scottish-Government, 2016d). HSCAD
produce a data specification document outlining the information that
should be returned for the SCS and this is sent to HSCAD via a secure
web-based system called ProcXed. This system supports data validation
checks on transfer to improve data accuracy (Scottish-Government,
2016d). The SCS contains unique ID numbers generated by local
authorities but does not routinely collect CHI numbers. In order for the
SCS to be linked to health data sources, HSCAD commissioned work to link
it to the NRS population spine using probabilistic linkage techniques.
This process is described more fully in Section \ref{sec:linkage}.

The SCS has been collected in its present form since 2013 as a
combination of two previous data collections - the Home Care Census and
the Self-Directed Support (Direct Payments) Survey (Scottish-Government,
2016d). Individual-level data has been collected since 2010. Some
questions have remained constant throughout this period but there have
also been some changes in definitions and measures.

The most recent SCS (2017) collected information on all individuals that
received community alarm, telecare, self-directed support (SDS) or
social work/support worker services during the previous financial year.
In addition, individuals that received home care services, meals,
housing support, shopping, or laundry services during a specified census
week are included in the survey.

Before 2013/14, information on telecare and community alarm services was
only collected for individuals receiving these services during the
census week. Furthermore, the value for total weekly hours of housing
support services was included in the value of home care services. The
separation of these services acknowledges that housing support is often
regarded as 24-hour-a-day-7-day-a-week service (Scottish-Government,
2016d).

For the value of total weekly hours of home care, HSCAD request details
on scheduled and actual hours of care delivered. Some local authorities
are able to return both values, others only return one value. Where both
are returned, actual hours of home care are used in official reporting
(Scottish-Government, 2016d). Approximately 129,000 people received
community alarms and/or telecare services, approximately 60,000 received
home care services, and approximately 8,000 received SDS funding in
2016/17 (Scottish-Government, 2016d). The overlap of individuals who
receive more than one of these services is unknown.

The cross-sectional nature of the survey, and in particular the census
week variables, mean that the SCS only collects a sample of the entire
population that receive social care in Scotland in any given financial
year. It is unknown how large this sample is. It is also impossible to
infer whether the values of total weekly hours of home care delivered to
individuals is representative of the care they receive throughout the
financial year. In order to gain a better understanding of these issues,
an exploratory project, using a richer data set, was conducted as part
of this thesis and is reported in Chapter \ref{ch:renfrew}.

\subsection{NRS population spine and death records}\label{subsec:source-nhscr}

The ``Research population spine" is a copy of the National Health
Service Central Register (NHSCR) and is controlled by NRS (NRS, 2018a).
The spine contains over 9 million records and is updated quarterly.
There are very strict policies which govern access to the offline secure
server where the spine is stored.

The NHSCR is used operationally for the purpose of transferring GP
records (NRS, 2018a). Despite the name and the fact it is used for
transferring patients records, the NHSCR does not hold medical records
themselves. It contains records of anyone who was born in Scotland, who
registers with a GP in Scotland, or who dies in Scotland. Variables
included are: forename, middle name, surname, date of birth, gender,
postcode, and country of birth.

This resource is extremely useful for administrative data linkage
projects. Data sources that don't contain a CHI number (such as the SCS)
can be matched to the population spine using deterministic and
probabilistic methods (see Section \ref{sec:data-linkage}). This then
allows linkage to CHI-based data sources enabling cross-sectoral
projects, such as the main analyses in this thesis, to be possible.

NRS also collates the register of deaths which includes details of every
death in Scotland since 1855 (NRS, 2018b). Details on the date of death
were requested for all individuals in the thesis study cohort.

\subsection{Prescribing Information System}\label{subsec:source-pis}

The Prescribing information system (PIS) contains all community
prescribed medicines for every individual in Scotland from 2009 onwards.
A full description of the PIS database and its applicability to research
has been published by Alvarez-Madrazo \emph{et al.} (2016). In brief,
data is collected to provide payment to community pharmacies for the
medicines dispensed to the population. The PIS database is formed by
combining information from prescribers and pharmacies via electronic and
paper media. From this, four types of variables can be used for research
purposes: patient specific data, prescriber data, dispenser data, and
drug data. An illustration of this process, using 2014 as an example
year, is provided by Alvarez-Madrazo \emph{et al.} (2016) and reproduced
in Figure \ref{fig:methods-pis}.

Drug data includes information on: the approved name (International
Non-proprietary Name (INN)), product name, extended British National
Formulary (BNF) code, formulation, strength, and quantity of each
supplied medicine (Alvarez-Madrazo \emph{et al.}, 2016). Distinction can
be made between drugs that have been dispensed rather than just those
prescribed which can avoid complications in counting, for example,
``just-in-case'' prescriptions or prescriptions not presented for
dispensing. The data base can be linked to health sources
deterministically via the Community Health Index (CHI) number.

    \label{fig:methods-pis}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Unscheduled care data}\label{subsec:source-ucd}

The Unscheduled Care Data Mart (UCD) is a database collated by ISD for
the purpose of understanding a patient journey through emergency and
urgent care services (ISD, 2017b). It is a linkage of routine health
data from a number of sources controlled by ISD: NHS24 telephone triage
service, Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS), primary care out-of-hours
services (PC OOH), Accident \& Emergency (A \& E), acute emergency
inpatient admissions (both general and mental health), and deaths. Data
is available from 2011 with the exception of PC OOH data which is
available from 2014. CHI numbers are available on all records.

Continuous Urgent Care Pathways (CUPs) are calculated that join together
records from each of these sources that occur within 24 hrs of each
other (or for services occurring within 48hrs of an acute emergency
admission) (ISD, 2017b). Details of all variables listed in UCD are
available in a background paper published by ISD (2017b). In addition to
service use, UCD flags presence of any of 14 long-term health conditions
in any of the above datasets and, additionally, any acute admission from
1981 onwards.

\section{Making social care data available for linkage}\label{sec:linkage}

The SCS does not routinely include CHI number as part of its annual data
collection but does have fields for other personal identifiable
information (PII) such as name, date-of-birth, gender, and postcode. In
order to make the SCS available for linkage to health sources, HSCAD
commissioned work to probabilistically match these identifiers to the
NRS population spine (described in Section \ref{subsec:source-nhscr})
and create read-through indexes for linkage purposes. This work was
undertaken by an analyst at NRS in 2017. Results have not been published
but a short report was produced.

The report described the variable quality in PII provided to the SCS by
local authorities. One local authority, Clackmannanshire, returned only
month/year of birth and truncated postcode data to the SCS. This meant
only 1\% of its records could be matched to the population spine. For
this reason, it was recommended that records for Clackmannanshire not be
included in any analyses.

Of the remaining 31 local authorities, 17 returned date-of-birth data
where a disproportionate number of records had the \emph{day} of birth
recorded as ``01''. Therefore, these council areas had their records
matched separately from the other 14 areas using a refined matching
algorithm.

Using this approach an overall linkage rate of 91.2\% for 31 local
authorities (removing Clackmannanshire) was achieved to the population
spine. Sensitivity analysis revealed consistent match rates across age,
sex, and SIMD deciles. However, there was much more variation in match
rates at the local authority level which ranged from 76.7\% to 97.9\% as
shown in Table \ref{tab:linkage-rates}.

\caption{Local authority linkage rates to the population spine}
\label{tab:linkage-rates}

\textbackslash end\{table\}

The variation in linkage rates indicates non-random missing data for SCS
data derived from population spine indexes. This makes comparison of
receipt of social care across local authority areas complex and a
national comparison is not possible. One potential way of creating
meaningful comparisons is to create sub-groups of local authorities by
similar match rates and compare receipt of care within these sub-groups.

\section{Creating a linked health and social care dataset}\label{sec:make-dataset}

The study cohort included all individuals in Scotland born before 31st
March 1951 and alive during the study period 1st April 2011 to 31st
March 2016. This identified all those over the age of 65 (and those
turning 65 during the study period). Data for the cohort was extracted
from the research population spine held by NRS with CHI numbers allowing
linkage to the other datasets described in Section \ref{sec:sources}.

As Figure \ref{fig:methods-linkage} shows, linkage keys from the
extracted cohort were sent by an eDRIS coordinator to various health and
social care data sources for extraction of information relating to any
of these individuals in the target data source. Specific variables
requested, the time period they were requested over, and cleaning and
wrangling of these data sources is described in this section.

The aim of cleaning and wrangling was to create one row of data for each
individual for each financial year (1st April - 31st March) of the study
period. This format is based on the principals of tidy data (Wickham,
2014). Financial years were chosen as the time period of interest
because the social care survey reports home care usage in a census week
which is usually at the end of March. As each raw data file provided was
in differing formats, this required differing approaches and relied
heavily on data manipulation software packages \texttt{tidyr} v0.7.2
(Wickham and Henry, 2017), \texttt{dplyr} v0.7.4 (Wickham and Francois,
2017), \texttt{lubridate} v1.6.0 (Grolemund and Wickham, 2017),
\texttt{stringr} v1.2.0 (Wickham, 2015), \texttt{forcats} v0.2.0
(Wickham, 2017), \texttt{data.table} v1.10.4 (Dowle \emph{et al.},
2018), and \texttt{zoo} v1.8-0 (Zeileis \emph{et al.}, 2018) in the R
language and environment for statistical computing version 3.4.0
(R-Core-Team, 2017) via the Integrated Development Environment RStudio
v1.0.143 (RStudio-team, 2016).

\subsection{Demographic, geographic, and deaths information}\label{subsubsec:nrs-summs}

Demographic information for all eligible individuals identified from the
population spine was extracted by the Public Health and Intelligence:
Strategic Business Unit at NSS. This was joined with a flag variable
indicating if an individual was resident in a care home (from
prescribing data) in a single file which was made available in the
national safe haven. SIMD decile was assigned as per the most recent
version of the area-based measure (Scottish-Government, 2016c).

Only month and year of birth were provided to avoid disclosure of
identifiable information. Age was calculated by flooring each
individual's \textbf{day}-of-birth to the 1st day of the
\textbf{month}-of-birth provided, and then calculating the difference
between this pseudo date-of-birth and the 31st of March in each
financial year.

The number of observations, individuals, and the differing variables in
this raw demographic file are shown in Table \ref{tab:demos}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Number of rows & Number of individuals & Variables \\ \midrule
1,348,310 & 1,134,445 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Index, year/month of birth, year/month of death\\ Sex, Address start date, Address end date, Care home flag,\\ Previous Local Authority, Current Local Authority, \\ Current Health Board, SIMD decile\end{tabular} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}%
}
\caption{Demographic file variables}
\label{tab:demos}
\end{table}

As the table indicates, some individuals had more than one row of
information indicating multiple addresses during the study period (and
thus potential multiple values for local, authority, health board, care
home flag, and SIMD decile). To overcome this, financial year time
intervals were created using the \texttt{lubridate} R package (Grolemund
and Wickham, 2017). Dummy variables were then created indicating the
age, local authority of residence, health board of residence, and SIMD
decile during each financial year (with null values where not
applicable). The variables were then gathered to long format in order to
reshape the data to include one row of data per individual per financial
year. Where an individual had multiple addresses during one financial
year, the most recent value for local authority, health board, and SIMD
decile was used. This resulted in a data frame of 7,775,410 observations
pertaining to 1,134,445 individuals.

\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Social Care Survey}\label{subsubsec:scs-summs}

Data from the Scottish Care Surveys 2010 - 2016 (including separate Home
Care Census and Self-Directed Support surveys for earlier years) were
extracted by a Scottish Government analyst and transferred to the
national safe haven in a single file. There were a number of variables
indicating the weekly hours of home care (if any) each individual
received, whether these were provided by the local authority or an
independent organisation, and whether they indicated the scheduled hours
of home care or the actual number of hours delivered. The SCS reports
statistics based on the actual hours of home care delivered where
available and uses the scheduled value where it is not. This convention
was also used for the purposes of this thesis.

Many variables requested from the SCS had large amounts of missing data.
There were also coding issues with extra values present that had no
corresponding description in the provided metadata. Variables with these
issues were dropped after discussion with the wider research team and
not included in analyses. Table \ref{tab:scs-vars} lists the variables
included and excluded after data cleaning.

A small fraction of observations (198 pertaining to 129 individuals) had
an impossible value of weekly hours of home care greater than 168 hrs
(more than 24hr-7-day-a-week care). These records were dropped from the
dataset after the entire social care file had been joined to other
sources of data (described in Section \ref{subsec:join-data}).

Assessment for duplicated rows indicated 4,357 individuals had more than
one row of data for some years of data. Inspection of these additional
rows indicated a change in value for some variables (e.g.~a flag
indicating use of community alarm services positive in one row and
negative in another, or different values for client group in multiple
rows). These additional rows amounted to 1.1\% of observations in the
SCS. The exact cause of these duplications is unknown. One possible
explanation is that duplication was created when records from different
sources were joined together in advance of being sent for linkage. A
further potential cause is the duplication of records created by the
process of recycling identification numbers in some local authorities.
Given the small percentage of records this affected, individuals with
duplicated information were also dropped from the dataset after being
joined to other files (as described in Section \ref{subsec:join-data}).

\subsection{Prescribing Information System}\label{subsec:pis-summs}

Community prescribing information for all individuals in the cohort were
extracted from the Prescribing Information System (PIS) by analysts from
ISD. For each quarter of the study period (Quarter 1 2010/11 to Quarter
4 2015/16) a list of medicines prescribed to each individual was
extracted and transferred in one file to the national safe haven. This
file contained 134,377,877 observations of four variables: The financial
year and quarter, the BNF subsection code, The approved name of the
medicine, and a count of how many times the medicine was prescribed in
the quarter. Coding errors were found in 138,973 observations (wrong
number of digits in the BNF subsection or characters found in the count
variable) and these were dropped from analysis.

The count of medicines was based on the BNF classes included in a count
of polypharmacy by Guthrie et al (2015). The additional material
provided on-line with this paper included a table of included drugs.
This table was amended to remove BNF subsections 3.9.1, 3.9.2, and 13.9.
The latter section includes different forms of shampoos whilst the
former 2 sections include preparations for coughs. These were not deemed
necessary to be included in overall counts. Two BNF subsections not
included in the Guthrie et al table were deemed important to include as
testing revealed large numbers of prescriptions included medicines from
these sections would have been omitted otherwise. These sections were
2.2.4 (Potassium sparing diuretics with other diuretics) and 2.2.8.
(Diuretics with potassium). In total, 198 medicines listed in the BNF
were not included and rows with these medicines were removed from the
PIS file. A full list of these medicines is shown in Appendix B. Table
\ref{tab:dropped-meds} shows the cleaning process.

\begin{table}[h]
\scriptsize
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lrr@{}}
\toprule

\end{tabular}
\caption{Prescribing Information System data cleaning}
\label{tab:dropped-meds}
\end{table}

A summary measure for each individual was created counting the total
number of repeat medicines prescribed in each financial year. To be
eligible in the count, a medicine had to be prescribed in at least 2
quarters of each financial year. This meant one-off prescriptions, such
as antibiotics for a transient infection, were not included in the
overall count. A separate count was conducted for individuals who died
in the first quarter of each financial year (and thus unable to have
medicines prescribed in two quarters). The total number of unique
medicines prescribed in the first quarter was used for these
individuals. This method broadly follows that used in a previous study
(Brilleman and Salisbury, 2013) which concluded such measurement had
potential as a proxy multimorbidity measure in primary care settings.
The only difference being the exclusion of medicines that were only
prescribed once during the financial year.

Using this method, each participant could thus have a maximum of 6
observations, one for each financial year. A second count was created
totalling the number of chapters of the BNF that each individual had
medicines prescribed from as a crude measure of body systems being
treated. Table \ref{tab:PIS-clean} shows the total observations and
variables in the cleaned PIS file.

\subsection{Unscheduled care measures}\label{subsec:usc-summs}

Unscheduled care information for all individuals included in the cohort
was extracted from unscheduled care data mart (UCD) by an analyst from
ISD. The raw file contained 3,772,402 observations from 845,893
individuals. Each observation related to a single continuous urgent care
pathway (CUP) as described in Section \ref{subsec:source-ucd}.

In a similar fashion to the wrangling conducted with demographics data,
dummy variables were created indicating if each observation occurred
within specified financial years during the study period. This enabled
data to be reshaped to a long format with individuals having one or
multiple rows of data for each financial year. To create one observation
per individual per year, data with information on each CUP was nested
within a data frame as a list column (described by Wickham \& Grolemund
(2017, p. ch.20)). With data in this format, summary measures were
derived by applying functions to the list column utilising the
\texttt{purrr} R package (Henry and Wickham, 2017). Derived information
included counts of total USC episodes, acute admissions to hospital, A
\& E attendances, and total number of long-term conditions identified
from admissions and A \& E data. The format of the cleaned UCD data
frame is described in Table \ref{tab:USC-clean}

Data were available beyond the study period ending 31st March 2016.
Records outside this end date were dropped when this file was joined
with the other sources of data which is described in the next section.

\FloatBarrier

\subsection{Joining sources together}\label{subsec:join-data}

\FloatBarrier

Following cleaning and formatting of each individual file, further
wrangling was completed which joined each file together in a parent data
frame to be used for analysis. This involved loading individual files in
one-by-one and joining them together using the ``full join'' function
from the R package \texttt{dplyr} (Wickham and Francois, 2017) using the
unique index number as the joining parameter. This process ensured all
records were retained, even if an index number was only present in one
file.

With all study data now in one data frame, further cleaning and tidying
was required. This was an iterative process. As initial descriptive and
statistical analysis was completed, identification of errors and data
quality issues required repetition of the joining process to address
these issues. This process is now described with a summary provided in
Table \ref{tab:joining}.

\caption{Joining files together and cleaning process}
\label{tab:joining}
\end{table}

Once all files had been joined together the parent data frame contained
8,094,256 observations. As there were discrepancies over time periods
for which data was provided in different files, the calculation of age
from the demographic file was not always present for all years of data
(e.g.~where demographic data was returned for the years 2015-2018 and
PIS data was available from 2011-2018). To overcome this, age was
recalculated from the pseudo date-of-birth (described in Section
\ref{subsubsec:nrs-summs}) for all financial years. Where an individual
died during a financial year, the age variable was left empty which
required additional rows to be added in some cases.

As described in Section \ref{subsubsec:scs-summs}, Approximately 4000
individuals had duplicated social care information for some years of
data. These rows, and other duplicates created by the cleaning process
involving age and date-of-death variables, were then dropped (37,513
records).

For the same reasons that age values were not shown in every year of
data, values for sex, local authority of residence, health board, and
SIMD decile were missing from 50,284 of observations (1.11\% of the
final cleaned data frame). These observations were filled by carrying
the last observation forward. Whilst this would not have affected values
for sex, potential error could have be introduced to the other
variables. Given the small percentage of affected observations this was
deemed acceptable. Despite this, there were still 7,435 records with
missing values for local authority. Cross referencing these individual
rows with the raw demographics data file revealed the values for local
authority in these observations were true missing data (not created by
data manipulation). Given the small proportion of records these
represented they were dropped from the data frame.

A further 1,832,446 observations were then removed from the data frame.
These observations were for years of data where individuals were either:
(a) under 65 years of age (the cohort comprised individuals over 65 or
\emph{turning} 65 during the study period), (b) resident in the
Clackmannanshire local authority area (linkage rates of the social care
survey to the indexing spine were too low to be reliable in this
council. (See Section \ref{sec:linkage} for details), or (c) contained
unscheduled care data for financial year 2017/18 which was well beyond
the study period.

Exploratory data analysis revealed three data quality issues that
required further observations to be dropped from the data frame.
Firstly, as described in Section \ref{subsubsec:scs-summs}, 168
observations contained implausible values for weekly hours of home care
(\textgreater168 hrs). These had not been removed as whilst cleaning the
social care file so were dropped here. Secondly, calculating average age
for each individual revealed 8,809 observations with a null value.
Further inspection of these observations identified each individual had
only one observation and had died before their 65th birthday. The
inclusion criteria for the cohort stated individuals should be ``born
before 31st March 1951 and alive during the study period 1st April 2011
to 31st March 2016''. This meant, for example, an individual born on
Christmas day 1949 and dying at age 64 on Christmas day 2013 was
extracted as part of the cohort data. These observations were also
dropped from the parent data frame. Finally, 23 rows of data were found
to have implausible values for SIMD decile. These observations were from
individuals living in either the Shetland Islands or Na h-Eileanan Siar
which only have data zones in 5 deciles making values outwith these
deciles impossible.

Whilst the study period had been defined as 1st April 2011 to 31st March
2016 some data files contained observations outwith this period. These
1,695,587 observations were maintained for exploratory analysis but were
dropped for final analysis. Thus, the final parent data frame used for
all reported analyses contained 4,519,306 observations.

Derived grouping variables were created for age group (5-year bands),
repeat medicines group (4 groups of similar size: 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, and
over 9 repeat medicines), and linkage group (grouping councils that had
linkage rates (described in Section \ref{sec:linkage}) within 4\% of
each other (e.g.~96-99.9\%, 92-95.9\% etc.)

\section{Statistical methods}\label{sec:methods-stats}

\subsection{Research question 1}\label{stats-rq1}

To address the question of how multimorbidity plus sociodemographic and
geographic factors influence the utilisation of social care, logistic
regression models were fitted separately to each financial year of data.
The dependent variable in these models was receipt of any form of social
care, measured by presence or not in the social care survey.
Observations where an individual had died during the financial year
(therefore had no chance of appearing in the SCS at the end of March)
and where an individual did not receive social care but was resident in
a care home (therefore not eligible for home-based social care) were
excluded from the model.

Independent variables and interaction terms were added incrementally to
assess impact on model fit which was measured by McFadden's pseudo
\(R^2\) (McFadden, 1974) calculated by the formula

\[R^{2}_{McFadden} = 1 - \frac {ln(LM_{1})}{ln(LM_{0})} \] Where:

\(ln(LM_{1})\) = log likelihood of the fitted model and:\newline
\(ln(LM_{0})\) = log likelihood of the null model (with intercept only
as a predictor).

McFadden's \(R^2\) values are not analogous with \(R^2\) values
calculated from linear models. Instead, values of 0.2 - 0.4 represent an
excellent model fit (McFadden, 1977, p. p35; Louviere \emph{et al.},
2000, p. p55).

The final models included: sex, age group, repeat medicines group, SIMD
decile of residence, and local authority of residence as independent
variables. Interaction terms were fitted between: sex \& age group, age
group \& repeat medicines group, SIMD decile \& repeat medicines group,
and SIMD decile \& local authority of residence. Exploratory models had
revealed a linear effect of SIMD decile on receipt of social care thus,
given the complexity of interaction terms and subsequent computational
requirement, SIMD was fitted as a continuous term in the final models.
The R code for the model was as follows:

As different local authorities had differing linkage rates from the
social care survey to the NRS population spine (Section
\ref{sec:linkage}), comparison between them is problematic as there are
differing levels of what is essentially missing data. To account for
this, separate models were fitted including only councils with similar
linkage rates and therefore similar levels of missing data. For the
purposes of this thesis, only councils with a high linkage rate of
either 92-95.9\% or 96-99.9\% were included in models. This meant,
overall, two models were fitted separately to five individual years of
data resulting in 10 final models.

With the exception of SIMD decile, all independent variables were
categorical in nature with a number interaction terms fitted as
described above. Odds-ratios are reported for individual independent
variables but interaction terms cannot be reported in this manner and
doing so often results in misinterpretation (Ai and Norton, 2003; Norton
\emph{et al.}, 2004; Mood, 2010; Mustillo \emph{et al.}, 2018).
Therefore, in order to provide a measure of the magnitude of the effect
of each variable (taking into account interaction effects), estimates
are reported as average partial effects (APEs) described by Mood (2010,
p. p75) with the formula

\[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n\beta_{x_1}f(\beta_{x_i})\] Where: \newline
\(\beta_{x_1}\) = the log odds-ratio for variable \(x_{1}\), \newline
\(\beta_{x_i}\) = the value of the logit for the \(i\)-th observation,
and \newline \(f(\beta_{x_i})\) = the probability distribution function
of the logistic distribution with regard to \(\beta_{x_i}\)

The effect estimate describes the average marginal effect (AME) at a
specific value of \(x_1\). Williams (2012, p. p325) provides an
intuitive example of how APEs are calculated and interpreted which has
been adapted to reflect the fitted model and uses the ``sex'' variable
as an example here

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Go to the first case. Treat that observation as if they were male
  regardless of actual sex. Leave other values of independent variables
  at their observed value. Compute the probability of receiving social
  care with the fitted model (including interaction terms).
\item
  Repeat, but change the value of sex to female.
\item
  The difference in the two probabilities is the partial (marginal)
  effect for that case.
\item
  Repeat for every observation in the data.
\item
  Compute the average of all the partial effects. This gives the APE for
  being female.
\end{itemize}

As Williams (2012) observes, this has the effect of comparing
hypothetical populations - one female, one male - with the same observed
values for other explanatory variables in the model. The only
differences between these hypothetical populations is their sex with the
estimate describing the differences in the probability of them receiving
social care.

Where categorical variables have more than one value (e.g.~age group),
the APE describes the average difference in the probability between the
observed value and the reference value for that variable (in the case of
age group the reference value is 65-69 years of age). Deprivation status
was modelled as a continuous variable therefore the APE is an
instantaneous effect reflecting the slope of the predicted probability
curve at the mean value of SIMD. Therefore, the value cannot be
interpreted directly as a coefficient and a one-step change does not
directly increase the value of the probability with the APE. To aid
interpretation, plots depicting the conditional effect of SIMD on the
receipt of social care were generated.

Reporting APEs has the advantage that effects can be compared across
groups, across samples, and across models (Mood, 2010). APEs were
calculated with standard errors and 95\% confidence intervals using the
R package \texttt{margins} v.0.3.23 (Leeper \emph{et al.}, 2017).

\subsection{Research question 2}\label{stats-rq2}

A similar strategy as applied to research question one was applied to
research question two. The aim in this analysis was to assess the impact
of sociodemographic factors, as well as multimorbidity and receipt of
social care, on unplanned admission to hospital. Again, logistic
regression models were fitted to each financial year of data. Models
were run using any admission to hospital in the six months \emph{after}
the end of the financial year as dependent variable.

The time frame was chosen as receipt of social care is measured by
having a record returned in the SCS which includes a census week at or
around the end of each financial year. Measuring unplanned admission in
the 6 months following this period offered the most accurate assessment
of the effect of social care receipt on the dependent variable.

Observations for individuals who died in the financial year were
excluded (as having no chance of being admitted to hospital six months
later). However, unlike the social care models in research question 1,
those living in care homes were included with this status included as an
independent variable. Exploratory models revealed little variation in
partial effects across local authority or health board areas and these
factors were not included in the final models reported. As social care
was an independent, rather than dependent, variable, models were not
broken down by linkage rate to SCS.

The final models included: sex, age group, repeat medicines group, SIMD
decile, receipt (Yes/No) of USC in the year prior to the outcome period,
receipt (Yes/No) of social care, and residence (Yes/No) in a care home
as independent variables. Interaction terms were fitted between: sex \&
age group, SIMD decile \& repeat medicines group, and age group \&
repeat medicines group. As in previous models, model fit was assessed
using McFadden's pseudo \(R^2\) and estimated effects were reported as
APEs (Section \ref{stats-rq1}).

\section{Timeline}\label{sec:timeline}

Figure \ref{fig:timeline} depicts major milestones during the thesis
project, including a separate analysis conducted with data from
Renfrewshire council. The journey through the approvals and analysis
process for that project is reported in Chapter \ref{ch:renfrew},
therefore this description focusses on the main analysis project.
Renfrewshire information is depicted to provide context to the time
frame of the whole project, in particular the availability of that data
arriving only shortly before the availability of data for the main
project.

Part of the first year of the project was spent scoping potential
sources of administrative social care data and appraising their
usefulness for research purposes. It was not until near the beginning of
the second year, August 2016, that HSCAD at the Scottish Government
confirmed it would make the Social Care Survey available for linkage.
This process was not completed until the end of June 2017 (Section
\ref{sec:linkage}).

Approvals process through the UBDC RAC was governed by its bi-annual
submission process - with approval for the main project being requested
in Autumn 2016. Approval from this committee was necessary before
applying to the PBPP which gave its approval for the main project in May
2017, subject to completion of a DSA between relevant parties. This was
finally signed (Appendix D) in November 2017. Some unlinked health data
from ISD was made available for analysis at this time, and shortly after
data from the Renfrewshire project had been made available. Social care
data was finally transferred, enabling full cleaning and analysis for
the main project to commence, in February 2018.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:methods-summary}

This chapter has described in detail the methods used to identify,
obtain, link, and analyse the administrative data used to answer the
research questions set in Chapter \ref{ch:intro}.

Information governance procedures can be complicated and lengthy,
however they are integral to the safe use of sensitive data for research
purposes. The procedures identified in the first section of this chapter
indicate the compliance of this project with required legal and ethical
frameworks and provide a guide to others planning to do similar work.

The second section provided a thorough description of the data sources
from which variables for the analyses were obtained. Social care data
has rarely been used for these purposes in the past. As such, greater
emphasis was placed on the description of the SCS. Potential data
quality issues arising from the SCS method of collection provide the
justification for the extra, stand-alone, analysis conducted in Chapter
\ref{ch:renfrew}.

    \includegraphics{data/produced_data/methods-chpt/timeline.png}
    \caption{Timeline of thesis project}
    \label{fig:timeline}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

The third section briefly described the linkage of the SCS to the NRS
population spine, carried out by an analyst at NRS, which enabled the
SCS to be linked to NHS records. After dropping data from one small
local authority due to poor quality data collection, a good overall
match rate of 91\% was achieved. However, the variation in the linkage
rate at the local authority level (76.7\% - 98.5\%) means that
comparison in rates of social care across council areas are problematic.
Because of this, the decision to model social care receipt using two
subsets of data including 18 local authorities with match rates of
96\%-99.9\% and 92\%-95.9\% was made.

The complex data cleaning and manipulation required to allow analyses to
be conducted was reported in the fourth section. This process was
conducted using the principals laid out in the tidy data framework
(Wickham, 2014) and involved extensive work before and after being
joined together.

The fifth section describes the statistical models applied to answer
research questions. As it has been seldom used in past Social
Science-based research, the process of calculating partial (or marginal)
effects from logistic regression models is described in detail. These
effects are preferable to reporting odds-ratios when interaction effects
are fitted in logistic regression models.

The final section outlined the timeline of the project and illustrates
the lengthy process of obtaining administrative data.

\section{Introduction}\label{renf-intro}

As described in Section \ref{subsec:source-sc}, the Social Care Survey
(SCS) is collected annually by the Scottish Government and provides
information on the types and amounts of social care delivered to
individuals in all 32 Scottish local authorities. This information is
collected in two ways depending on which service an individual may
receive. Since 2014/15 the survey has collected data on all individuals
who receive a community alarm service, a telecare service,
self-directed-support, or assistance via a social or support worker at
any time during the financial year. Home care data is collected only for
individuals receiving this service during a census week - usually
including the date 31\textsuperscript{st} March (Scottish-Government,
2017e). Prior to 2014/15, all data was collected for the census week
only. The cross-sectional nature of the data collected for home care
services means that the SCS does not identify every individual who
receives social care in any given financial year. This has implications
for the interpretation of research projects using the SCS and the
statistical inferences that can be applied to the data when linked with
other sources of information.

This aim of this chapter is, therefore, to estimate the completeness of
the SCS and give an indication of the demographic make-up and type of
care received by those who are ``captured'' in the SCS census compared
to those who are not. This is done by a descriptive analysis of complete
data from one local authority area which also identifies how many more
individuals receiving home care would be identified by collecting data
from one census quarter, rather than one census week.

All data relating to home care services from Renfrewshire council were
de-identified and transferred securely to a safe haven environment to
enable analysis. Information of differing types of home care services
were summarised and a weekly time series indicating the amount of
service provision in each week for each individual was created for the
period April 2006-March 2016. This enabled quantification of the amount
of people receiving care in each week (including the census week),
quarter, and financial year; as well as the total amount of care
provided over each financial year.

\section{Background}\label{sec:renf-background}

    \caption{Time periods for which social care data is collected}
    \label{fig:ren-scs-data}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:ren-scs-data} depicts the differing time periods over
which variables are collected by more recent versions of the SCS and the
proposed one quarter collection of data for financial year 2017/18. The
convention in this chapter is to refer to the data collected during the
census week collectively as ``home care''. This term can, however, refer
to a number of services previously described in Chapter
\ref{ch:lit-review} (Table \ref{tab:methods-homecaredefs}) and reprinted
in Table \ref{tab:renf-homecaredefs}. In 2015/16, a total of 31.2\% of
all social care users over the age of 65 were classified as receiving
home care (Scottish-Government, 2017e).

\end{table}

Two reasons that individuals may receive home care services but not be
captured by the SCS include death before the census week and receipt of
short-term home care services over a period not including the census.
Whilst it is difficult to quantify numbers of people who fall into the
former category with administrative data not linked to death records,
this chapter provides some insight into levels of the latter. Given
intentions to amalgamate the SCS with administrative resources collected
by ISD and move to a one quarter collection of data (ISD, 2017a), the
exploratory project also aimed to quantify the percentage of all
individuals that would be identified by collection of home care data in
quarter 4 of each financial year. This quarter was the proposed time
period for collection of the 2017/18 census.

As social care data in Scotland has rarely been used for research
purposes, this exploratory project also offered the opportunity to
assess the format, content, and suitability of the data from a research
perspective. Ideally, data would be analysed from a number of local
authorities for comparison. However, as described below, acquiring
sensitive data of this nature is a lengthy and complicated process,
relying heavily on the goodwill of the participating local authority.
Despite early intentions to approach multiple local authorities,
practical considerations limited the project to data collected from
Renfrewshire Council.

The decision to approach Renfrewshire Council as a potential source of
data was due to convenience given previous cooperation between the
council and UBDC on other projects. Another local authority was also
approached but preliminary discussions suggested that, whilst the
purpose of proposed research was supported, the council was unlikely to
be able to provide sufficient resource to facilitate data sharing.
Preliminary meetings with data analysts from Renfrewshire council
confirmed that data could be provided to facilitate the proposed
research and the formal process of obtaining data using UBDC's
controlled data service was instigated in April 2016.

Despite there only being a single source of data, Renfrewshire Council
offers an excellent location in which to explore the receipt of social
care given it is fairly representative of Scotland as a whole. It is the
10\textsuperscript{th} largest local authority with 3.2\% of the total
population of the country. It has a similar proportion of individuals
aged over 60 compared to the rest of the country (24.4\% v 24.2\%) (NRS,
2015) and the mortality rate is only slightly higher than recorded for
the rest of Scotland (10.9\% v 10.3\%). Some of the most and least
deprived datazones in the whole of Scotland as well as a spread of urban
and rural neighbourhoods are present in Renfrewshire
(Scottish-Government, 2017c).

In terms of social care, the 2017 SCS (Scottish-Government, 2017d,
supp.charts) shows that the proportion of over 65s receiving home care
provided or administered by Renfrewshire Council reduced between 2011
and 2015 but has nearly returned to 2010 levels (52.4 per thousand in
2010, 49.4 per thousand in 2017). Historically, this is lower than
levels seen across Scotland as a whole, although national levels are now
very similar (60.8 per thousand in 2010 to 48.9 per thousand in 2017).
The absolute number of over 65s receiving home care in Renfrewshire in
the 2010 census week was 1526 versus 1614 in the 2017 census
(Scottish-Government, 2017d, supp.charts).

\section{Methods}\label{sec:renf-methods}

\subsection{Project approvals and timeline}\label{subsec:renf-methods-approvals}

The exploratory project utilised the controlled data service provided by
UBDC and therefore required approval from UBDC's Research Approvals
Committee (RAC). This process is more fully explained in Section
\ref{subsec:rac} Approval from RAC was gained on 01/06/2016. Ethical
approval for the study was gained from the University of Glasgow College
of Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee on 24/05/2016 (Appendix C).

Following academic and ethical approval the process of obtaining a data
sharing agreement (DSA) between the University of Glasgow and
Renfrewshire council was instigated. This involved the production of an
agreement in principle and privacy impact assessment as a basis for the
DSA. Production of the DSA involved the input of legal teams from both
institutions as well as liaison with data analysts at Renfrewshire
council and UBDC. The initial draft was produced by the local authority
with amendments from both sides before final completion and signing
06/09/2017. Final transfer of data took place on 21/09/2017. An
illustration of this timeline is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ren-timeline}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Data}\label{subsec:renf-methods-data}

As with all services provided by Renfrewshire council, home care data is
collected to ensure efficient management of the service and as evidence
of service provision (Renfrewshire-Council, 2015). Recording of
individual episodes of care also helps with budgetary management of the
service.

Data was provided in the format of one observation per individual per
\emph{episode} of care. Each observation contained variables on: how
many days per week and how many hours per day of home care an individual
received for each type of care (e.g.~mainstream or reablement etc. as
described in Table \ref{tab:renf-homecaredefs}). In addition, variables
indicating the start and end dates of each episode as well as the
service provider (e.g.~local authority or independent provider) were
present. Data was provided for all home care episodes in the
Renfrewshire council area between April 2006 and April 2017. Demographic
information detailing gender and year of birth was provided in a
separate file. The provision of year of birth only meant age had to be
calculated from the 1st of January in the provided year.

\subsection{Analysis}\label{subsec:renf-methods-analysis}

To enable analysis of the proportion of individuals captured by the
census in each year, a time-series was created for the study period
27\textsuperscript{th} March 2006 to 28\textsuperscript{th} March 2016
at weekly intervals. The value of total hours of home care each
individual was receiving for each type of service at each of the 523
weekly time points was identified. From this time series, weekly counts
of the total number of individuals receiving home care were calculated.
Additional tables counting the number of individuals receiving home care
in quarter 4 of each financial year were also created. In order to
validate the method used to count individuals, comparison was made
between counts for each census week and the value indicated to be
receiving home care in the SCS (Scottish-Government, 2017d).

As it was possible for individuals to receive home care of more than one
type or experience gaps in provision of care in each financial year,
individuals were grouped by those that had received any type of care
during the census week and those that had none. This enabled comparison
of the proportions of each age group, gender, as well as the type,
amount, and duration of home care received between groups that were
identified in the census or not.

\caption{Pseudo table example of calculation of total care received}
\label{tab:renf-pseudo-tab}
\end{table}

To report the proportion of all home care provided to individuals
captured (or not) by the census, an aggregate value of total care
provided was required. To facilitate this, a variable was created
indicating the number of changes in care an individual received during
each year (e.g.~moving from 4hrs to 3hrs of care per week - see Table
\ref{tab:renf-pseudo-tab}). The total care per episode was calculated by
multiplying the sum of weekly hours and number of meals received per
week by the number of weeks each episode of care lasted within each
financial year. From these values, it was then possible to calculate a
total value for each individual in each financial year. Adding values
for all individuals in each financial year gave a value for total home
care delivered and percentages of this value received by those captured
during the SCS census week or quarter 4 of each year could then be
calculated.

To the author's knowledge, no previous research or published statistics
has created a measure indicating the comparative value of one meal with
hours of home care provided. The above method effectively assigns a
value of 1hr of home care to each meal per week delivered. The outcome
required for this analysis is to identify what proportion of care is
delivered to those captured by census periods and it is therefore not
necessary to identify a true comparative figure for meals to hours of
home care as it is highly unlikely to bias the results.

Duration of care was calculated by the time elapsed from the beginning
of each financial year to either the week where care was terminated or,
for those receiving care for over one year, to the end of the financial
year. Average total weekly hours of care was calculated by summing the
weekly hours of care of each care type received by an individual an
calculating the mean value received over the course of the financial
year. As the home care packages of the types ``Community Mental
Health'', ``Overnight Services'', ``Housing Support'', and ``Extra Care
Housing'' accounted for small percentages of care delivered, individuals
receiving these types of care were omitted from comparative plots.

All data cleaning and analysis was conducted using the R language and
environment for statistical computing version 3.5.1 (R-Core-Team, 2017)
with additional software packages: \texttt{dplyr} v0.7.8 (Wickham and
Francois, 2017), \texttt{tidyr} v0.8.2. (Wickham and Henry, 2017),

\caption{Percentage of individuals receiving each type of home care service}
\label{tab:renf-types_hc}
\end{table}

Individuals could receive more than one type of care service within any
financial year. Calculating the percentage of all individuals receiving
each type of service within each year revealed that the most utilised
type of care was ``Care at home (Mainstream)'' services (Table
\ref{tab:renf-types_hc}). This accounted for the vast majority of all
home care delivered during the study period, however the percentage of
individuals receiving this service decreased over time (98\% in 2006/07
to 72\% in 2015/16). Meals and Reablement were the next most utilised
services. Classification of Reablement only began in 2010/11 and quickly
became heavily used with approximately one-third of individuals
receiving this service between 2012/13 and 2015/16. Other services were
much less utilised with very low percentages of individuals receiving
them.

\subsection{Counts of individuals receiving home care}\label{subsec:renf-res-counts}

Approximately 60\% of all individuals receiving home care in each
financial year also received care during the census week. This indicates
they would have observations returned to the SCS (Figure
\ref{fig:ren-hc-counts}). The percentage receiving care during the
census week decreased over time from over 62.0\% in 2006/07 to 57.3\% in
2015/16 (Table \ref{tab:ren-hc-counts})

Figure \ref{fig:ren-hc-counts} also shows that, were the census period
extended to include all those receiving home care during the last
quarter of each financial year, approximately 70.0\% of all individuals
receiving care across the whole year would be returned in the SCS.
Again, the percentage decreased over time from 72.0\% in 2006/07 to
68.8\% in 2015/16 (Table \ref{tab:ren-hc-counts}).

Finally, Figure \ref{fig:ren-hc-counts} and Table
\ref{tab:ren-hc-counts} show the difference between counts of
individuals receiving care in each census week produced by this analysis
and the value shown in the SCS. There was some variation with slight
over and under counts in different years. The largest difference is an
over count of 103 individuals in 2012/13 and the smallest an undercount
of 5 individuals in 2006/07.

Individuals in receipt of home care during the census week accounted for
a large majority of all home care delivered in the Renfrewshire area
during a financial year (calculated by the sum of total hours of home
care per week and number of meals per week multiplied by the number of
weeks of care). Whilst these individuals represent 57\% to 62\% of all
individuals receiving care, over the course of a financial year they
received between 71\% and 78\% of all home care provided (Figure
\ref{fig:renf-totalcare}). This value peaked in 2009/10 and has
gradually reduced since then.

If the home care data had been collected from quarter 4 in each year,
the proportion of all home care received by those captured in this
hypothesised census period would be even larger. The figures rise to
between 84\% and 88\% (Figure \ref{fig:ren-totalq4care}).

There are some variations in the percentage of individuals receiving
home care when grouped by receipt of care during the census week (Figure
\ref{fig:ren-age-sex}). The percentage of males and females aged 65-69
not captured by the census was below the overall figure of 42.7\% in
2015/16 whilst there was a higher proportion of males in age groups over
80 (similar patterns are seen across all years). It follows that the
opposite is true for the group captured by the census where higher
percentages of 65-69 year-old males and females and lower percentages of
males in older age groups than the 57.3\% overall figure were seen.
Apart from these differences, the distribution of receipt of care
follows the overall pattern.

The introduction and increasing usage of reablement services over time
shown in Table \ref{tab:renf-types_hc} can be seen clearly in Figure
\ref{fig:ren-types}. Higher than average percentages of those receiving
Reablement and Rapid Response services were \emph{not} captured by the
census. Conversely, below average percentages of those receiving
Mainstream and Meals services received care during periods not including
the census week. The lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:ren-types} shows the
opposite picture.

\end{figure}

The median duration of home care for within each financial year for
individuals whose care overlaps with the census week was considerably
higher than for those whose care did not (Figure
\ref{fig:ren-duration-1}). The distribution of duration of care was
tight around 52 weeks for those captured by the census. Those not
captured had a wider, even distribution of care duration. These patterns
remained when broken down by care type (Figure
\ref{fig:ren-duration-2}). Outlying points in figures
\ref{fig:ren-duration-1} to \ref{fig:ren-hrs-2} have been removed to
prevent identification of individuals.

Figure \ref{fig:ren-hrs-1} plots the distribution of mean total weekly
hours of home care received by individuals in each financial year. With
the exception of 2009/10 and 2010/11, the median value of mean total
weekly hours of home care received was lower for the group who received
care that overlapped the census week. The difference between median
values in each group was higher from 2011/12 onwards. This coincided
with the increase in usage of Reablement services (Figure
\ref{fig:ren-hrs-2}). From 2012/13 onwards the distribution of weekly
hours of care for Reablement services was so tight that no box or
whiskers are visible in the plot which instead shows a line at 7 hours
in both groups. Comparison of the distribution of mean weekly hours
showed similar values within care types across both groups (captured or
missed by the census).

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:renf-discuss}

\subsection{Findings}\label{subsec:renf-discuss-find}

In the Renfrewshire council area, approximately 60\% of individuals who
received home care were likely to be captured in the SCS. Since 2010/11
(the year when individual-level data was first collected by the SCS)
these individuals received between 70\% \& 75\% of all home care
delivered during the entire financial year. If a census quarter, rather
than a census week, had been used as the data collection period, then
over 70\% of individuals, receiving approximately 85\% of all home care
delivered, would have been captured. There were no major differences in
the age and gender of those captured in the census although there was
some variation at higher and lower age ranges. Individuals receiving
Mainstream and Meals services were more likely to be captured in the
census than those receiving Reablement or Rapid Response services. The
nature of these latter services contributes to the fact that those
missed by the census were much more likely to receive care over a
shorter number of weeks albeit with higher intensity care provision
(measured by average weekly hours of care received). This means that
individuals in receipt of longer-term home care services were more
likely to be captured in the census.

Identification of the percentage of individuals receiving home care
during the SCS census week and, more importantly, the share of all home
care provision they receive indicates the only estimate of home care
coverage in the SCS to date. Knowledge that individuals receiving home
care who were captured in the census received up to three-quarters of
all provided home care in the financial year is reassuring. This is
likely to improve with proposed new data collection periods which could
capture individuals receiving in excess of four-fifths of all home care
delivered.

The data made available by Renfrewshire council did not indicate where
services had stopped due to mortality. Therefore, the figures suggested
for the proportion of home care users captured by the SCS are likely to
be an underestimate where analyses model social care data from the SCS
and omit individuals who died (such as those found in Chapter
\ref{ch:res2}).

Whilst quantifying the percentage of home care users and the share of
care they receive is useful, interpretation of the coverage of the most
recent years of the SCS (from 2014/15 onwards) must also consider the
fact that individuals receiving telecare or community alarm services at
any time in the financial year are included. Indeed, home care services
accounted for only 31.2\% of all individuals over 65 receiving social
care in 2015/16 (Scottish-Government, 2017e). It is possible that
individuals who receive alarm or telecare services may also have home
care during the financial year but not at a time that coincides with the
census date. This could result in an overestimate of the proportion of
individuals missed by the census in this analysis. Given those with home
care outwith the census week are more likely to receive short bursts of
care, the magnitude of this potential error is likely to be small,
though difficult to quantify.

For those \emph{not} captured in the census, there were even
distributions of duration of care across all types. Given their
temporary nature, this would be expected for Reablement and Rapid
Response services. The fact that the distribution is even for those
receiving Mainstream or Meals services (which generally last more than a
year) indicates a random aspect as to when the service comes to an end
supporting the hypothesis that death may be a cause of cessation of
care.

Those that \emph{are} captured in the census tended to have been
receiving care for a longer period. Interestingly, those captured by the
census and receiving Reablement or Rapid Response services also had
longer overall durations of care compared to those not in the census.
Both Reablement and Rapid Response services are intended as short,
stop-gap interventions but it is possible some individuals go on to
require longer-term care and end up being re-classified as receiving
Mainstream services. This may explain the slightly wider distribution of
duration for individuals captured by the census receiving these services
compared to Mainstream or Meals services.

Reablement and Rapid Response services are delivered with greater
intensity as measured by average total weekly hours of care received.
The lack of variation in this value for Reablement services seen in
Figure \ref{fig:ren-hrs-2} indicates almost all individuals receiving
this service do so for seven hours a week (most likely as
one-hour-per-day). There are no major differences between the
distributions of mean weekly hours within care types.

Considering all similarities and differences between groups of
individuals captured and not captured in the census a picture emerges
indicating that those missed by the census have either ceased to receive
care altogether (most likely due to death), or were in receipt of short,
intense forms of home care such as Reablement or Rapid Response
services. The census is likely to catch individuals in receipt of
Mainstream or Meals services who have been receiving them for longer
terms and also those receiving short forms of care that happen to
overlap the census week.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{subsec:renf-discuss-lim}

This analysis is limited by the fact that data was obtained from only
one local authority area. Whether the number of individuals captured or
not by the SCS in the Renfrewshire area is indicative of numbers across
the country is unknown. Given each of the 32 local authorities in
Scotland have bespoke methods of delivering and recording social care
the findings from this analysis cannot be immediately generalised to a
national level. The findings do, however, give the only indication yet
attempted of how representative the SCS is.

Furthermore, the method of summarising data into packages of care is
subjective and may differ from the method used by Renfrewshire council
to complete the SCS. Absolute numbers of individuals receiving home care
in each financial year in this analysis are similar to those returned by
Renfrewshire council to the SCS overall with some mild discrepancies.
Eligibility to be included in the home care census has changed over the
years (e.g.~``Housing Support'' and ``Overnight Services'' being
included as home care and then collected as a separate type of service
in later years) and the collection of individual-level data did not
begin until 2010/11. Whether this has changed how data is collated at
the local level for return to SCS is unknown but may explain differences
in counts.

Data provided by Renfrewshire council was not linked to any other
sources of information relating to included individuals. As such, a
final limitation was that analyses were not able to account for events
that could contribute to initiation or termination of home care such as
a move to or from a care home; or, as discussed above, due to death.

\subsection{Implications}\label{subsec:renf-discuss-imp}

The findings from this analysis provide the only estimation to date of
the proportion of home care users identified by the SCS in any given
financial year. Caution is required when generalising these findings to
the whole of Scotland. However, the findings suggest a plausible figure
to aid interpretation of administrative data linkage research conducted
with the SCS (such as described in other chapters of this thesis). This
suggests the method of data collection for the SCS is a reliable method
for capturing the majority of social care delivered by local
authorities. Inclusion of all home care users receiving services over
quarter 4 in the 2017/18 census should increase the percentage of users
captured by approximately 10\% to roughly 70\% and coverage of all care
delivered from approximately 70\%-75\% to approximately 80\%-85\%.

The analysis of the data from Renfrewshire council has shown there are
different patterns in the duration and intensity of home care packages
according to the type of care being provided (e.g.~between ``Care at
home (Mainstream)'' and ``Rapid Response'' type packages). The SCS does
not collect data on the categorisation of care type - apart from a
single flag identifying Reablement services in more recent collections.
Therefore, the differences in services cannot be accounted for in
research using the SCS. Adding a standardised classification of home
care type to the SCS would allow a richer interpretation of home care
users for both official statistical reporting and research purposes.

\subsection{Future work}\label{subsec:renf-discuss-future}

Future work using this data should consider the difference in
individuals receiving care at different time intervals (e.g.~first six
months of the financial year). If the census week were to capture a
higher proportion of individuals in a narrower time-frame then
alternative types of statistical analyses, such as time-to-event
(survival) analysis, may be possible using SCS data.

The data from Renfrewshire council also offers the opportunity to
longitudinally analyse home care use by age, gender, and type of home
care groups. Quantifying any differences in the change over time in the
amount of home care used would be of interest to both researchers and
local authority providers.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:renf-conc}

Analysis of individual level social care data from Renfrewshire council
area suggests that the number of people recorded as receiving home care
by the Social Care Survey captures approximately 60\% of the total
number of people that will receive home care during a financial year.
These individuals receive 70\%-75\% of all home care provision in any
year. Those not captured during a census week are likely to be
individuals who died or received short-term care only. Since 2014/15,
improved data collection of telecare and alarm services has resulted in
individuals receiving home care accounting for approximately 30\% of all
social care users over 65. The figures reported in this chapter relate
to this minority of social care users in these years. Collection of
additional data in the SCS, such as start and stop dates for all
packages of care and type of home care delivered, would improve the
inferences that can be made from the SCS currently.

\chapter{Results 1 - Descriptive statistics}\label{ch:results-1}
\thispagestyle{empty}

This chapter switches focus to the main linkage project described in
Chapter \ref{ch:data} and provides some answers to the first half of the
first research question:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item What are the socioeconomic, demographic, and multimorbidity patterns in the use of social care?
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Chapter \ref{ch:res2} completes the answer to research question 1(a) (as
well as the other research questions). This chapter outlines the
characteristics of the created health and social care cohort by
providing descriptive statistics of pertinent variables in five
sections. The first section concentrates on characteristics by age \&
sex, by mortality, and by local authority area. The next section
focusses on the proxy measurement of multimorbidity, repeat medicine
counts, and its distribution by sociodemographic variables. The third
section focusses on deprivation, the fourth on receipt of any form of
social care, and the final section characterises unplanned admissions to
hospital. In all but the first and fourth sections, the distribution of
the receipt of social care by the main variable of interest is included;
the fourth section specifically investigates social care receipt. Where
distributions were found to be similar across all years of data a
reference year, financial year 2015/16 - the most recent of the study
period, is used for visualisation/tabulation purposes.

\caption{Characteristics of study population}
\label{tab:results1-cohorttab}
\end{table}

There were 1,100,675 individuals included within the study across all
years with increasing numbers in each financial year as shown in Table
\ref{tab:results1-cohorttab}. Percentages in each gender group and of
those that died were relatively stable across the study period. Age was
also relatively stable across all years with almost one-third of the
cohort in each year being aged between 65 and 69 years old whilst over
half were under the age of 75.

In terms of healthcare, the vast majority of individuals had a least one
repeat prescription in any given year, whilst the percentage of
individuals with at least one unplanned admission to hospital was
relatively stable over time. In contrast, the pattern in \emph{absolute}
numbers with a prescription or unplanned admission showed a gradual
increase over time shadowing the increase in overall numbers in the
cohort in each year.

Social care services showed slightly less stability in terms of numbers
and percentages of individuals receiving care. A jump of approximately
10,000 people receiving any form of social care was found between
financial years 2013/14 and 2014/15 reflecting a change in data
collection methods in the SCS. Conversely, the number flagged as living
in a care home showed a gradual decrease over time.

\subsection{Age and sex}\label{subsec:results1-age-sex}

    \includegraphics{figures/chapter-results-1/02_age_sex_plot.pdf}
    \caption{Age and sex distribution}
    \label{fig:results1-age-sex}
\end{figure}

Using financial year 2015/16 as a reference, Figure
\ref{fig:results1-age-sex} shows the breakdown by age and sex (similar
patterns are seen across all years of data). There were more females
than males in every age group with the difference between sexes widening
as age increased. Over half of the cohort were under the age of 74 and
over a quarter were between the ages of 75 and 84.

\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Mortality}\label{subsec:results1-mortality}

    \caption{Mortality}
    \label{fig:results1-mortality}
\end{figure}

In 2015/16, 4.1\% of the cohort died (37,992 individuals) within that
year. Figure \ref{fig:results1-mortality} shows how these deaths were
distributed across age and sex groups (with similar patterns seen in
other years). The highest percentages of deaths (approximately 20\%)
occurred in the 80-84 and 85-89 age groups with females accounting for
over half of these. The difference in the percentage of deaths between
males and females increased from the 80-84 age groups to older age
groups, whereas higher percentages of men died in age groups below
80-84.

\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Local authorities}\label{subsec:results1-la}

Figure \ref{fig:results1-la} shows the percentage of individuals in the
cohort that lived in each local authority area in financial year
2015/16. The largest percentages of individuals were found in Glasgow
and Edinburgh city areas, whilst the smallest number were found in the
three island local authorities. This is as expected based on the general
population distribution.

\section{Repeat medicines}\label{sec:results1-mm-meds}
\subsection{Distribution by sex}\label{subsec:results1-meds-sex}

The distribution of number of repeat medicines prescribed in 2015/16
revealed the most common value to be zero (Figure
\ref{fig:results1-meds-hist}). Otherwise, a positively-skewed normal
distribution was seen with higher numbers of females receiving every
number of repeat medicines. This pattern was repeated across all study
years.

\FloatBarrier
\subsection{Percentage by sex, age group, and deprivation}\label{subsec:results1-meds-age}

Despite overall numbers for specific counts of medicines being higher
for females, the \emph{percentage} of males and females receiving repeat
medicines was similar as shown in the left-hand panel of Figure
\ref{fig:results1-meds-age-grp}. There were, however, differences in the
pattern of percentages by age groups and SIMD deciles. The shape of the
distribution shifts further to the right for both older age groups and
more deprived SIMD deciles. Combining these factors (Figure
\ref{fig:results1-meds-simd-age}) reveals that the differences in
deprivation deciles was more pronounced at younger ages and was much
less obvious in older age groups where overall numbers are smaller.

Figure \ref{fig:results1-meds-grp} shows the distribution of the
percentage of individuals receiving numbers of repeat medicines within
defined groups. Each group contained either slightly more or less than
25\% of the total cohort with 0-2 and 3-5 groups being slightly larger.
The same pattern was seen across all years of data. These groups are
used as a proxy measurement of multimorbidity in models reported in
Chapter \ref{ch:res2}.

\caption{Characteristics of study population by repeat medicine group. 2015/16}
\label{tab:res1-mmgroups}
\end{table}

A higher percentage of females were found in the highest multimorbidity
group (9+ repeat medicines) compared to the overall percentage of
females in the cohort, whereas a higher percentage of men were found in
the lowest group (0-2 repeat medicines) compared to the overall
percentage of males (Table \ref{tab:res1-mmgroups}). The median age of
individuals in each multimorbidity group rose with severity from 70
years in the lowest group to 76 years in the highest. In younger age
groups, the percentage of individuals in lower medicine groups (0-2,
3-5) was higher than found in the overall population whilst the
percentage in higher medicine groups (6-8, 9+) was lower. The converse
was true in older age groups. Hypothesis testing indicated the
differences between these variables across medicine groups was
statistically significant.

There was also a statistically significant difference in SIMD deciles
across medicine groups. Whilst 8.3\% of the cohort in 2015/16 lived in
the most-deprived SIMD Decile 1 areas, only 5.7\% of those receiving 0-2
medicines came from the same group. Conversely, 12.4\% of those
prescribed 9+ medicines lived in a SIMD Decile 1 area. In contrast,
those living in the most-affluent SIMD Decile 10 areas accounted for
9.9\% of the overall cohort. The corresponding figures for 0-2 and 9+
groups were 12.9\% and 6.2\% respectively.

There was a noticeable relationship between service use and
multimorbidity groups. Of those prescribed 0-2 repeat medicines, 3.4\%
were in receipt of social care compared to 24.0\% of those prescribed 9+
medicines. The overall percentage receiving social care was 11.6\%.
Similarly, 6.4\% of those in medicine group 0-2 had an unplanned
admission to hospital compared to 31.8\% of those prescribed 9+
medicines. Overall, 15.8\% of the cohort had an unplanned hospital
admission in 2015/16. Again, hypothesis tests showed the differences
within these variables were statistically significant.

\section{Deprivation}\label{sec:results1-deprivation}

\subsection{Participants}\label{subsec:dep-parps}

Breaking the cohort in 2015/16 down by deprivation decile shows
statistically significant differences in all variables (Table
\ref{tab:results1-deprivation}). The absolute number of males and
females in Deciles 1 (most deprived) and 2 was lower than seen in other
deciles. The percentage of those living in Decile 1 areas and male was
less than seen in the overall cohort whilst the percentage of females
was higher. The converse was true in Decile 10 (most affluent). There
was a higher percentage of deaths in Deciles 1-3 (5.4\%, 4.9\%, and
4.8\%) compared to the overall cohort where 4.1\% of people died. Only
3.1\% of individuals resident in Decile 10 datazones died in 2015/16.

The value of median age in Deciles 3 \& 4 was one year higher than other
deciles. Differences in age are more easily visualised by comparing
Decile 1 and 10 across age groups to the overall figures. For example,
8.4\% of the overall cohort in 2015/16 were aged 85-89. The
corresponding figures in Deciles 1 and 10 were 8.1\% and 8.8\%
respectively.

The median value of total repeat medicines decreased from six in Deciles
1-3 to four in Deciles 7-10. The percentage of individuals living in
Decile 1 datazones (most deprived) in each repeat medicine group
gradually increased from 18.6\% receiving 0-2 medicines to 32.4\%
receiving 9+ medicines. The opposite is true for those living in Decile
10 (most affluent) datazones where the corresponding figures were 35.5\%
and 13.6\%.

In terms of service use, the percentage of individuals living in Decile
1 (most deprived) areas and receiving social care was 15.9\%. This value
gradually decreased through SIMD deciles, apart from a small spike in
Decile 3, to Decile 10 (most affluent) where only 7.7\% of individuals
received social care. The overall percentage of those in receipt of
social care was 11.6\%. A similar pattern was seen in unplanned hospital
admissions where the percentage of those with at least one admissions
decreased from 21.7\% in Decile 1 to 12.0\% in Decile 10; the overall
figure being 15.8\%.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:results1-age_simd} shows that the percentage of the
cohort living in SIMD Decile 1 areas was below 10\% for both sexes and
decreased with age. Males in Decile 2 also showed lower percentages and
a reduction in overall make-up of the cohort at older ages.

\subsection{Deprivation by local authority}\label{subsec:dep-la}

    \label{fig:results1-la-simd}
\end{figure}

The percentage of individuals from the cohort living in each of the SIMD
deciles by local authority area of residence in the financial year
2013/14 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:results1-la-simd}. The figure
reveals large variation in percentages in each decile according to each
local authority. For example, approximately one-third of individuals in
the City of Edinburgh lived in a Decile 10 datazone (the most affluent)
whilst a similar number lived in a Decile 1 datazone in the Glasgow City
area. Fife and Renfrewshire councils (and to a lesser extent South
Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire) showed the most even distribution of
population across deprivation deciles albeit with slight
discrepancies\footnote{Providing evidence that Renfrewshire is a good case-study area to have used in chapter 4}.
Island local authority areas do not contain datazones from all 10
deciles and tended to have populations concentrated in the middle of the
spectrum (a pattern also present in the Highland council area with
smaller percentages seen at the extremes).

\FloatBarrier
\section{Social Care}\label{sec:res1-sc}

Figure \ref{fig:results1-sc-demos} illustrates that age was a
significant contributing factor to the receipt of any form of social
care with the percentage of the population receiving care increasing
rapidly from age 65 to 95 regardless of sex, deprivation status or
repeat medicine group. Despite this, there were noticeable differences
within each of these groups with females, those in more deprived SIMD
deciles, and those with higher multimorbidity status (measured by
medicine group) showing higher percentages of individuals receiving
social care at all ages. Looking across groups reveals a higher
percentage of individuals prescribed nine or more repeat medicines
received care than any other group at all but the oldest ages.

These differences are also seen in Figure \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-2}
which is a heatmap that allows the distribution of social care in
2015/16 to be visualised across four variables: age group, sex, SIMD
decile and repeat medicine group. In each of the fourteen age/sex
groups, each tile is shaded according to the percentage of social care
users in each SIMD decile and repeat medicine group. For example, the
uppermost left-hand tile shows the percentage of all males aged 65-69
receiving social care that lived in Decile 1 areas and were prescribed
9+ repeat medicines.

The darker shades in the figure show those in the lowest multimorbidity
group received very little social care across all age, sex, and
deprivation groups. In all but the highest multimorbidity groups, the
variation in social care receipt in each age/sex group was small across
SIMD deciles. For those in younger age/sex groups receiving nine or more
repeat medicines, the percentage of those receiving social care was
higher in more deprived SIMD deciles and gradually reduced to more
affluent deciles. Other multimorbidity groups showed less variation in
the percentage of social care received across deprivation deciles.

\FloatBarrier
\section{Unplanned hospital admission}\label{sec:res1-adm}

Age was also an important driver in the percentage of individuals having
at least one unplanned hospital admission (Figure
\ref{fig:results1-adm-demos}), although this was to a lesser extent than
seen for social care. In contrast to social care receipt there was
relatively little difference between sexes on unplanned admission.
Similarly to social care, however, there were marked variations within
deprivation and multimorbidity groups. Again, those in more deprived
areas and with higher repeat medicine counts being more likely to have
had an unplanned admission at all ages.

This can be more easily visualised in Figure
\ref{fig:results1-heatmap-4} which shows the distribution of unplanned
hospital admission across age/sex groups by deprivation and
multimorbidity status. Similarly to the distribution of social care,
there was little variation in rates of admission across SIMD deciles
except for those in the highest multimorbidity group. In this group,
those in more deprived deciles had a higher rate of admission.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:res1-summary}

This chapter has described the cohort created by linking the SCS to
various health datasets as described in Chapter \ref{ch:data}. The
overall number of individuals over the age of 65 in each financial year
gradually increased from 2011/12 to 2015/16. The distribution of
individuals in age, sex, repeat medicine, and local authority groups was
similar across all financial years with the most recent, 2015/16, used
for the majority of figures and tables in the chapter.

In relation to research question 1(a), findings in this chapter show the
percentage of the cohort receiving social care increased rapidly with
age. There were differences in receipt of social care across sex,
socioeconomic position, and multimorbidity measures with women, those in
more deprived areas, and those receiving 9+ repeat medicines more likely
to have received care than other groups. The variation in socioeconomic
position, measured by SIMD decile, showed a gradient from most-deprived
to most-affluent; and was more obvious for those receiving 9+ repeat
medicines than other multimorbidity groups. Further findings in relation
to research question 1(a) are presented in the summary of Chapter
\ref{ch:res2}.

The patterns shown for receipt of social care were also seen in the
percentage of individuals in the cohort with at least one unplanned
hospital admission. The only exception to this was that men and women
have similar rates of unplanned admission whereas women had higher rates
of social care receipt.

Results concentrating on the distribution of the proxy multimorbidity
measure showed similar patterns. The percentage of those in the most
severe multimorbidity group (9+ repeat medicines) was higher in those
that were older, living in more deprived areas, receiving social care,
and with at least one unplanned admission to hospital compared to
percentages seen in the overall cohort.

\chapter{Results 2: Models}\label{ch:res2}
\thispagestyle{empty}

This chapter reports results of the analyses conducted to answer
research questions 1 and 2 namely:

In people over the age of 65 in Scotland:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item What are the socioeconomic, demographic, and multimorbidity patterns in the use of social care? 
\item Is there an association between receipt of social care and multimorbidity status. Does this vary by the patterns described in 1(a)?  
\end{enumerate}
\item Is there an association between unplanned hospital admission, multimorbidity, and the receipt of social care?
\end{enumerate}

As described in Section \ref{stats-rq1}, receipt of social care was
measured by an individual having a record present in the SCS of any
year. This could be in relation to any form of social care provided, or
commissioned, by a local authority. As linkage rates from the SCS to the
population spine varied at the local authority level, direct comparison
of levels of care across all councils is impossible. For this reason two
groups, together representing \textasciitilde58\% of the overall cohort,
are compared in relation to research question 1 in the first two
sections of this chapter. The third section aims to answer research
question 2. A brief summary of results is also provided. Discussion of
the key findings and implications are found in Chapter
\ref{ch:discussion}.

\section{Social care - group 1}

\subsection{Models for councils with link rate greater than 96\%}\label{sec:96plus}

This section covers results of logistic regression models applied to the
group of individuals in local authorities where a match rate greater
than 96\% was achieved when linking the SCS to the population spine.
Nine local authorities are included in the models: Falkirk, Angus, East
Ayrshire, Inverclyde, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, North Ayrshire,
Dumfries \& Galloway, and Argyll \& Bute. These areas exclude the four
largest city councils but include a diverse mix of large town,
ex-industrial, and rural local authority areas.

In total, five models are reported - one for each financial year of
data. As in the previous chapter, where results are broadly consistent
across years, 2015/16 is used as a reference year to convey results.

The R code for the model fitted to this first group of data was as
follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

    \DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ thesis)       }\CommentTok{#identify which data to use}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

R automatically fits all included variables individually before adding
interaction terms. As described in Section \ref{sec:methods-stats}: the
size of the dataset, the linear effect of SIMD decile on social care
receipt found in exploratory models, and the complexity of model
interaction terms (with subsequent computational requirement) led to the
decision to fit SIMD decile as a continuous, rather than categorical,
term.

\caption{Group 1. Characteristics of those not receiving/receiving social care. 2015/16}
\label{tab:res2-chars1516}
\end{table}

There were 234,392 individuals included in the model for 2015/16 for the
nine local authorities (Table \ref{tab:res2-chars1516}) which accounted
for 25.4\% of the overall cohort in that year. There were similar
numbers included in models for other years. Proportions of
females/males, age groups, and repeat medicine groups were broadly
similar to the overall cohort as reported in Chapter \ref{ch:results-1}.

Table \ref{tab:res2-chars1516} shows females represented a much higher
percentages of those that received social care (68.6\% v 31.4\%) despite
representing only 54.8\% of the overall group. Almost 50\% of those that
received social care were between the ages of 80 and 89 despite these
age groups representing 21.2\% of the group. Although individuals living
in SIMD deciles 1 and 10 were under-represented compared to the overall
cohort (7.8\% and 4.9\%), the percentage receiving social care in more
deprived SIMD deciles was higher than in the most affluent. Increasing
severity of multimorbidity, measured by repeat medicine group, also
showed increasing rates of social care receipt. This was seen most
obviously where individuals receiving 9+ medicines accounted for 46.9\%
of all those receiving social care despite representing only 22.1\% of
the group. Falkirk, East Ayrshire, and Inverclyde local authorities had
higher rates of social care than their relative size in the group. The
converse was true for Dumfries and Galloway and Argyll and Bute council
areas. Statistically significant results were found for all variables
with Chi-squared tests for differences within groups.

\textbackslash end\{table\}

The rate of social care receipt \emph{within} local authority areas,
unlike other variables in the models, can fluctuate over time as shown
in Table \ref{tab:res2-la}. There was no discernible pattern across
council areas; some showed gradual decreases over time, others gradual
increases, whilst others fluctuated in both directions. Generally, all
councils saw an increase in the percentage of those receiving care from
2014/15 onwards reflecting the change in data collection to include
individuals receiving community alarm or telecare services at any time
in the financial year. However, this increase was not sustained in all
areas: Falkirk, Angus, and South Lanarkshire showed reductions in
2015/16 compared to the previous year.

\subsection{Model results}\label{subsec:96plus-results}

Adjusted odds ratios for age groups and repeat medicine groups in the
fitted model (for 2015/16) increased from young-to-old and low-to-high
respectively (Figure \ref{fig:res2-group1-OR}). Females were shown to be
more likely to receive social care than males. The effect of SIMD,
modelled as a continuous variable, was marginally negative which
indicated an increase in SIMD decile from deprived to affluent was
associated with a reduced chance of receiving social care. All local
authorities showed reduced odds of receiving social care compared to the
reference group (Falkirk), but not all differences were statistically
significant.

\end{figure}

Given the difficulties in interpretation of interaction terms in
logistic regression models (discussed in Section
\ref{sec:methods-stats}), these are not shown in Figure
\ref{fig:res2-group1-OR}. Tabulation of full model results for 2015/16
are available in Table \ref{append-tab-2} in Appendix D.

In order to aid interpretation of the magnitude of influence each
variable has on the receipt of social care, Average Partial Effects
(APEs) were calculated. These are discussed fully in Section
\ref{sec:methods-stats}. In short, APEs for categorical variables
indicate the marginal effect of each value of the variable on the
outcome, taking into account all other variables and interactions. For
continuous variables (here only SIMD decile), the value of APE is an
instantaneous effect indicating the slope of the predicted probability
curve at the mean value.

\caption{Group 1. Average partial effects. 2015/16}
\label{tab:res2-model1-APE}
\end{table}

APEs for each variable in each model (year) are plotted by order of
magnitude in Figure \ref{fig:res2-model1-APE} with values for 2015/16
shown in Table \ref{tab:res2-model1-APE}. All values are adjusted for
other variables in the model. Age had the largest positive effect with
the probability of receiving social care being approximately 45\% higher
for those over 95 compared to those aged 65-69 in all models
(specifically 46.6\% in 2015/16). Age bands 90-94, 85-89, and 80-84 also
showed very strong effects (\textasciitilde40\%, \textasciitilde28\%,
and \textasciitilde15\% higher probability of receiving social care
across all models).

Multimorbidity also had a strong positive effect on receipt of social
care, although the magnitude of this effect was lower than that of
higher age groups. Those receiving 9 or more repeat medicines had an
\textasciitilde15\% higher probability of receiving social care compared
to those receiving 0-2 repeat medicines in all years (15.3\% in
2015/16). This effect was a similar magnitude as the APE of being 80-84
compared to 65-69 years of age. Medicine groups 6-8 and 3-5 had
respectively \textasciitilde7\% and \textasciitilde3\% increased
probability of receiving social care compared to those receiving 0-2
medicines.

Females had an increased probability of receiving care of
\textasciitilde4\% compared to males for all models (exactly 4\% in
2015/16). SIMD decile was modelled as a continuous variable. The APE of
-0.006, after adjustment for other variables, in 2015/16 (Table
\ref{tab:res2-model1-APE}) indicates the coefficient of the slope at the
average value of SIMD (5.2, SD 2.6). The overall slope can be seen in
the conditional effect of SIMD shown in Figure
\ref{fig:res2-model1-simd} and indicates the effect of SIMD is smaller
than seen for other variables.

    \label{fig:res2-model1-simd}
\end{figure}

With the exception of higher age groups where numbers were small, local
authorities displayed more variation in APEs across models than other
variables over time. This is more easily visualised in Figure
\ref{fig:res2-model1-APE-time} which shows that the difference in APEs
\emph{within} councils was fairly stable and shows some narrowing
\emph{between} councils in 2015/16. Controlling for age, sex,
deprivation, and multimorbidity attenuated some of the variations seen
in Table \ref{tab:res2-la} with the largest difference in probability
across all nine included local authorities being 5\% (comparing Dumfries
\& Galloway to the reference group: Falkirk).

\section{Social care - group 2}

\subsection{Models for councils with link rate between 92\% and 95.9\%}\label{sec:9296}

In this section results of logistic regression models applied to the
group of individuals in local authorities where a match rate between
92\% and 95.9\% was achieved when linking the SCS to the population
spine. Nine local authorities are included in the models: Shetland
Islands, Glasgow City, Na h-Eilenanan Siar, East Renfrewshire, City of
Edinburgh, East Dunbartonshire, Fife, Perth \& Kinross, and South
Ayrshire. This presents a larger, and more diverse, group of local
authorities including small islands, large cities, affluent suburban,
and ex-industrial areas.

In a similar fashion as the previous section, five models are reported -
one for each financial year of data and where results are broadly
consistent across years, 2015/16 is used as a reference year to convey
results. Results here are restricted to show differences with the models
fitted in the previous section.

The R code for the model fitted to the second group was identical to
that reported in the previous section, the underlying group of data
being the only change.

2015/16, Table \ref{tab:res2-2-chars1516}). Patterns in receipt of
social care were broadly similar to those seen in group 1 (Table
\ref{tab:res2-chars1516}) with females, those aged 80-89, and those in
higher multimorbidity groups representing higher percentages of those
receiving care. In contrast to group 1, group 2 had an
over-representation of individuals that lived in SIMD deciles 1 and 10
(11.5\% and 15.8\%) which likely reflected the inclusion of Glasgow City
and City of Edinburgh councils. These are the two largest Scottish local
authorities and have large proportions of their population in decile 1
or 10 respectively (Figure \ref{fig:results1-la-simd}). Nevertheless,
taking into account the over-representation, the pattern of higher rates
of social care receipt in lower SIMD deciles was also present in group
2. Distribution of social care across local authority areas broadly
followed the relative size of each council, with the exception of
Glasgow City (higher rate of social care compared to relative size) and
City of Edinburgh and South Ayrshire (lower rate of social care compared
to relative size).

In a similar fashion as seen in group 1, the rate of social care
\emph{within} local authorities varied over time (Table
\ref{tab:res2-mod2-la}). Again, no obvious pattern was present, with
rates fluctuating over time. Some councils showed an increase in rates
with the change in data collection method in 2014/15, whilst others
showed a decrease. The most obvious factor in Table
\ref{tab:res2-mod2-la} is that Shetland Islands council provided care at
a much higher rate than seen in other councils, although this decreased
over time.

\subsection{Model results}\label{subsec:9296-AME}

Adjusted odds ratios for individual values showed similar patterns, but
lower values, to those found in group 1. A full table of model results
for group 2 (2015/16) can be found in Figure \ref{fig:res2-model2-or}
and Table \ref{append-tab-3} in Appendix D.

Broadly similar patterns of APEs were found for sociodemographic and
multimorbidity group variables in group 2 as were found in group 1
(Figure \ref{fig:res2-model2-APE}); although these were of lower
magnitude throughout. The only slight exceptions were for the oldest two
age groups and the highest multimorbidity group where APEs were slightly
less and the 85-89 age group where the APE was slightly higher compared
to group 1.

\caption{Group 2. Average partial effects. 2015/16}
\label{tab:res2-model2-APE}
\end{table}

More variation was seen across years for council areas than was evident
with group 1 and noticeably larger confidence intervals can be seen in
Figure \ref{fig:res2-model2-APE}. The gradual increase in APEs reflects
the large reduction in the percentage of individuals receiving care over
time in the reference group (Shetland Islands) from a high starting
point. This makes comparison to the reference group less informative.
However, APEs can still be interpreted between other values (councils)
in the variable. Excluding the reference group, there was little
variation in APEs \emph{between} and \emph{within} councils, although
there was some widening across councils in the most recent year of data.
The difference in probability of receiving social care between Na
h-Eileanan Siar and South Ayrshire was 6.2\% in 2015/16.

Table \ref{tab:res2-mod2-gof} shows the results of diagnostic tests for
the models applied to each financial year of data. McFadden's pseudo
\(R^2\) statistic ranged from 0.196 for the model applied to 2011/12 to
0.209 for the model applied to 2015/16. The models applied to the most
recent two years of data had an excellent fit, whereas the previous
three models were only marginally below the threshold of 0.2 generally
regarded as representing an excellent fit.

\section{Unplanned hospital admission}\label{sec:res3-usc}

In this section the dependent variable for modelling is any unplanned
hospital admission in the six months following the end of each financial
year. This time period was chosen to allow inclusion of social care
(measured by presence in the SCS collected at the end of each financial
year) as an independent variable in the model.

As in previous sections in this chapter, logistic regression models are
applied to each financial year of data, five models in total, and
2015/16 is used as a reference year where results are consistent across
models. Exploratory models revealed local authority and health board
area of residence had little impact on outcomes so they were omitted
from the final models. This meant data was not subset as in previous
sections and models were fitted to the whole cohort in each year.

The R code for the model fitted to the data was as follows.

In 2015/16, 886,331 individuals were included in the model representing
95.9\% of the cohort in that year (Table \ref{tab:res3adm-chars1516})
with only those that died during the financial year being omitted from
models. As such the sociodemographic make up was representative of the
overall cohort. Chi-squared testing revealed no statistically
significant difference between the numbers of females and males with an
unplanned admission (54.8\% v 45.2\%, p = 0.221). There were however,
statistically significant differences in all other groups. Older, more
deprived, and individuals with higher multimorbidity had higher rates of
unplanned hospital admission compared to the relative size of the cohort
they represented. For example, those aged 80-84 represented 13.8\% of
the cohort but accounted for 20\% of all unplanned admissions.
Similarly, those prescribed nine or more repeat medicines represented
21.4\% of the cohort but 43.6\% of all unplanned admissions. Other
variables of interest included those in receipt of social care (11.3\%),
and those with an episode of USC in the previous year (28.2\%), who
accounted for 29.8\% and 56.5\% of unplanned admissions respectively.
Those resident in a care home also had a slightly higher rate of
unplanned admission compared to the relative amount of the cohort they
represented (5.7\% v 3.2\%).

\subsection{Model results}

Figure \ref{fig:res3-adm-OR} and Table \ref{app-tab4} in Appendix D show
adjusted odds ratios for individual variables in model fitted to data
for 2015/16. As with previous models and explained in Section
\ref{sec:methods-stats}, APEs are used for the main substantive
interpretation of models.

After adjustment, the APEs for models with unplanned admission to
hospital as dependent variable were much lower in magnitude for all
variables (Figure \ref{fig:res3-adm-APE} and Table
\ref{tab:res3-adm-ape1516}) compared with models fitted in sections
\ref{subsec:96plus-results} and \ref{subsec:9296-AME} where social care
was the dependent variable.

\textbackslash end\{table\}

High multimorbidity, measured by prescription of 9 or more repeat
medicines, had the largest magnitude of APE in the unplanned hospital
admission model in all years (an 8.3\% increased probability of having
an unplanned admission compared to those with 0-2 repeat medicines in
2015/16, Table \ref{tab:res3-adm-ape1516}). Other multimorbidity groups
also showed increasing probability of admission compared to the
reference value as severity increased.

In terms of other service use, having any USC episode in the previous
financial year was associated with a \textasciitilde7.5\% increase in
probability compared to those with no previous USC use. Similarly,
receipt of social care measured in the SCS was associated with a
\textasciitilde6.5\% increase in the probability of having an unplanned
hospital admission compared to those with no social care. There was a
split in the direction of the effect of living in a care home after
2013/14. After this year being in a care home was associated with a
decrease in the probability of unplanned admission of almost 1\% whilst
in previous years the probability had increased by almost 1\%.

Higher age groups were also associated with higher APEs compared to
other variables in the models though there were wider confidence
intervals than seen with social care models. Furthermore, the magnitude
of the effect of increasing age was much lower than the effect on
receipt of social care. For example, in 2015/16 being 90-94 was
associated with a 7.5\% increased probability of having an unplanned
hospital admission compared to being 65-69. The corresponding value for
receiving social care in that age group was a 41.7\% increased
probability (group 1, Section \ref{subsec:96plus-results}). Otherwise,
increases in APEs were seen through age groups.

Despite no statistically significant difference in the number of males
and females with an unplanned admission in descriptive Table
\ref{tab:res3adm-chars1516}, modelling revealed that females were almost
2\% less likely to have an admission after adjusting for other variables
(1.6\% in 2015/16).

SIMD decile, again fitted as a continuous variable, had a smaller effect
on hospital admission after accounting for other variables. The
coefficient of the slope at the average value of SIMD (5.6, SD 2.8) was
-0.003 (Table \ref{tab:res3-adm-ape1516}). The overall slope of the
conditional effect of SIMD can be viewed in Figure
\ref{fig:res3-adm-simd} in Appendix D.

model. The value of McFadden's \(R^2\) was fairly stable over time
varying from 0.111 to 0.114. These values were well below those seen for
social care models and represent a poorer fit to the data in comparison.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:res-2-summary}

Results from Sections \ref{sec:96plus} and \ref{sec:9296} provide
answers to research questions 1(a) and 1(b):

In people over the age of 65 in Scotland:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item What are the socioeconomic, demographic, and multimorbidity patterns in the use of social care? 
\item Is there an association between receipt of social care and multimorbidity status. Does this vary by the patterns described in 1(a)?  
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Descriptive statistics in Chapter \ref{ch:results-1} indicated that
higher percentages of people that were female, in higher age groups, and
with lower socioeconomic position received social care compared to
others in these groups. Sections \ref{sec:96plus} and \ref{sec:9296} add
to these findings by showing adjusted APEs in 2015/16 of: 4.0\% \& 3.2\%
for females and 46.6\% \& 41.4\% for age group 95+. These figures
indicate the increase in probability of receiving social care compared
to the comparator value in each group, males and age group 65-69
respectively, and were broadly consistent across all years 2011/12 to
2015/16 in both sets of data.

The large APE values for age-group 95+ should be interpreted in the
light that only 0.8\% and 0.9\% of all individuals in groups 1 and 2
respectively were of this age. Nevertheless, a clear pattern of
increasing magnitude of APEs was seen in older age groups, particularly
over the age of 80.

Due to computational restraints, SIMD decile was modelled as a
continuous variable and is interpreted differently from categorical
variables. In both groups, APEs were negative indicating a reduced
probability of receiving social care for those living in more affluent
SIMD deciles. This reflected the higher percentages of social care
receipt for those living in more deprived SIMD deciles shown in Table
\ref{tab:results1-deprivation}. It is possible that other variables in
the model, such as age and multimorbidity group, attenuated some of the
effect of SIMD. Indeed, Figure \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-2} shows that
in all age/sex groups the distribution of social care receipt did not
vary by much across SIMD deciles, except for those in the highest
multimorbidity group.

A final finding relevant to research question 1(a) was the variation in
receipt of social care at the local authority level. Ignoring Shetland
Islands council as an outlier still revealed a difference of 6.2\% in
the APE between Na h-Eileanan Siar and South Ayrshire councils. This
was, however, the largest inter-council difference in group 2 (the
corresponding largest difference in group 1 was 5\%) and many APEs for
local authorities were broadly similar.

In terms of an association between receipt of social care and
multimorbidity, models showed an increase in probability of receiving
social care for individuals in more severe multimorbidity groups
compared to the reference group: 0-2 medicines. The use of partial (or
marginal) effects to interpret logistic regression models allowed
comparison of effect sizes across variables and models after adjustment
for all included independent variables (Mood, 2010). In both groups of
data, models across all years showed the partial effect of being in the
highest multimorbid group compared to the lowest was of similar
magnitude to that of being aged 80-84 compared to being aged 65-69
(Figures \ref{fig:res2-model1-APE} and \ref{fig:res2-model2-APE}). In
other words, after adjustment for age, sex, and sociodemographic
variables, being in the highest multimorbidity group is equivalent to
being 10-15 years older than the baseline age group.

Section \ref{sec:res3-usc} provides results relevant to research
question 2: Is there an association between unplanned hospital
admission, multimorbidity, and the receipt of social care?

Models fitted with unplanned hospital admission as the outcome variable
showed an increase in the probability of unplanned admission for
individuals in more severe multimorbidity groups and those receiving
social care compared with the reference in each variable: 0-2 medicines
and those not in receipt of social care respectively.

Other independent variables fitted in the model that showed positive
adjusted APEs were: increasing age and utilisation of any form of USC in
the 12 months prior to the exposure period.

Negative adjusted APEs were found for females compared to males and
residency in a care home compared to those who were not. The direction
of effect for the latter is only seen in 2014/15 and 2015/16 with
positive effects of similar magnitude seen in earlier years.

SIMD decile, again modelled as a continuous variable, showed similar
effects to those seen in social care models. Cross-referencing Figure
\ref{fig:results1-heatmap-4}, which shows little variation in the rate
of unplanned admission except for those in the highest multimorbidity
group, provides some explanation of the low effect size of SIMD.

\chapter{Discussion}\label{ch:discussion}
\thispagestyle{empty}

This chapter discusses key findings from the thesis and places their
implications in context. Given the broad nature of analyses, these are
discussed in separate subsections. A section comparing findings to
previous research is then presented before a section outlining the
general strengths and limitations of the thesis. The final section
outlines recommendations for future research.

\section{Key Findings in Context}\label{sec:key-finds}

This section is split into five subsections detailing key findings and
their implications from analyses and the PhD research in general: a)
Patterns in receipt of social care, b) Patterns in unplanned hospital
admissions, c) Health and social care interaction, d) social care data,
and e) Linked administrative data research.

\subsection{Patterns in receipt of social care}\label{subsec:mm-sc-kfinds}

An important aspect of the research conducted for this thesis was to
identify if a relationship between multimorbidity and social care
existed as this had been identified as a gap in existing empirical
knowledge. The results indicate that such a relationship does indeed
exist and that the effect of this relationship grew as the severity of
multimorbidity (measured by grouped repeat medicine counts) increased.
After adjustment for age, sex, and sociodemographic variables, being in
the most severe multimorbidity group was associated with a 15\% increase
in the probability of receiving social care. This was equivalent to
being 10-15 years older than the baseline age group.

These findings are important for both health clinicians and policy
makers. High levels of multimorbidity have the potential to indicate
need for social care which should be a consideration when assessing this
patient group. Consideration of the effect of multimorbidity on social
care providers, rather than just health care providers, should be
applied by clinicians, policy makers, and researchers. Given the
increasing prevalence of multimorbidity and the reduction in funding for
social care (discussed in chapter \ref{ch:lit-review}), urgent
consideration of social care provision and funding by policy-makers is
warranted.

This argument has further support given that social care receipt also
has, unsurprisingly, a strong association with age which is likely to
reflect higher levels of frailty. Given demographic trends, the demand
for social care services is only likely to increase.

This is the first study, to the author's knowledge, that has analysed
the receipt of social care by socioeconomic position at a national
level. Results here indicate higher levels of social care receipt in
more deprived SIMD deciles. This is particularly true for those in the
most severe multimorbidity group and remains after adjustment for other
variables. These findings present no obvious evidence of an ``inverse
social care law'', although the lack of good measures of social care
need mean definitive conclusions in this regard cannot been drawn.

Furthermore, although variation in receipt of social care between local
authorities is present, linkage rates to CHI across council areas was
also variable. Despite attempts to groups councils with similar match
rates, the lack of multi-level modelling in analysis means robust
conclusions about regional variation in receipt of social care cannot be
drawn at present. Further exploration is warranted.

Multimorbidity status attenuates some, but not all, of the higher rates
of social care received by females. The remaining gap between sexes in
social care receipt could potentially be explained by two reasons.
Firstly, females may be more likely to live alone and therefore have
greater need for social care in older age. Secondly, females may be more
likely to provide, and less likely to receive, informal care to or from
a partner. Whilst a variable for living arrangements is available in the
SCS, there are high levels of missing data meaning it could not be
accurately included in models.

In summary, the analysis indicates that social care receipt is driven
primarily by age and multimorbidity status. These factors attenuate a
large proportion of the greater rates of care delivered to females and a
partial proportion of the greater rates seen in those living in more
deprived areas. No obvious evidence of an ``inverse social care law'' is
found. The findings do, however, support the ``intensification''
description of social care provision described in Chapter
\ref{ch:lit-review} where tightening eligibility criteria have resulted
in care being focused on those with highest need. Increasing prevalence
of multimorbidity and the increasing proportion of the population in
older age groups are likely to lead to higher demand for social care
services.

\subsection{Patterns in unplanned hospital admissions}\label{sec:dsicuss-adm}

Receipt of social care is positively associated with unplanned admission
to hospital carrying a 6\% - 7\% increased probability compared to those
not in receipt of care. After adjusting for age, sex, sociodemographic,
and multimorbidity status, the effect of receiving social care on
admission is similar to being 20 years older than the baseline age
group.

It is possible, therefore, to draw a conclusion that receipt of social
care is likely to be an indicator of underlying health need. This would
further confirm discussions regarding ``intensification'' of social care
services in Chapter \ref{ch:lit-review}. Importantly, results show no
evidence that receipt of social care in itself reduces unplanned
admission to hospital. Any benefit from the integration of health and
social care services, therefore, are more likely to be found in improved
liaison between services preventing delayed discharge, rather than
prevention of admissions. This information is highly pertinent to policy
discussion on the expected outcomes from recent legislative change in
Scotland, and potential change in the rest of the UK.

Findings also confirm that increasing age and multimorbidity are
associated with unplanned admission to hospital. Indeed, being in the
highest multimorbidity group was the strongest predictor of all included
variables. Previous use of USC services was also shown to have an
increased probability of unplanned admission compared to those that had
not used USC. Coupled with the effects of receipt of social care, these
findings suggest a proportion of unplanned hospital admissions are
driven by high users of all health and social care services.

One group that showed a reduced likelihood of unplanned hospital
admission were those that live in care homes, although findings varied
across models. The direction of effect changes from 2014/15 onwards. In
models fitted to earlier financial years, living in a care home has a
small (\textless1\%) increase in probability of unplanned admission.
Models fitted to data from 2014/15 and 2015/16 show a decreased
probability of admission of almost 2\%. It is difficult to ascertain the
cause of this change. The obvious temporal difference could have a
number of explanations including policy change or, more likely, change
in data collection methods.

The models fitted to identify factors associated with unplanned hospital
admissions had a poor fit in all years and, therefore, caution is
required when interpreting results. There is the possibility that other
unmeasured factors could improve model fit. It also notable that the
magnitude of APEs were considerably smaller than seen for social care
models suggesting more complex factors associated with unplanned
hospital admission may exist.

In summary, those that receive social care and those that have used
unscheduled health care services in the financial year prior to the
exposure period have a higher probability of unplanned hospital
admission. Age and multimorbidity are also shown to have a positive
association unplanned admission. Caution is required in interpreting
these results given the poorer fit to data found with logistic
regression models.

\subsection{Health and social care interaction}

Two further (linked) implications regarding health and social care
interaction, relevant to both modelled outcomes, are described here.

The first is related to preventative measures. Given the strong effects
increasing multimorbidity has on receipt of both social care and
unplanned hospital admission (visible in heatmaps and model results),
the results of analysis add weight to the many calls for a focus on
preventative public health measures to attenuate the need for services.
Compared to the highest multimorbidity group, those receiving 6-8 or 3-5
repeat medicines had much lower rates of unplanned admission and social
care use. Those, even at older ages, in the lowest multimorbidity group
(receiving 0-2 repeat medicines) had very little use of either service.
Preventative measures that reduce the proportion of the population in
the highest multimorbidity group could have a big impact on demand for
health and social care services. Given the strong association between
socioeconomic position and multimorbidity, attention to the social
determinants of health in this regard is important.

Relevant to this argument is discussion regarding primary care (e.g.~WHO
(2016a) and section \ref{subsec:litrv-mm-context}) where universal
coverage, despite issues with the inverse care law, is generally
regarded as the most appropriate way of improving access to service in
order to deliver effective (and preventative) care for those with
multimorbidity. Whether universal coverage of social care could have the
same effect, and potentially mitigate the need for unplanned admission,
is a matter of debate. However, the current means-and-needs tested model
of social care provision in the UK is unlikely to help in this regard.
With a link established between multimorbidity and social care use,
identifying interactions between primary care and social care use is now
an important potential research avenue requiring exploration.

\subsection{Social care data}\label{sec:disc-sc-data}

The first aim of the PhD was to identify what Scottish social care data
sources existed that could be linked to health data and asses their
suitability for research purposes. The SCS was identified as the most
suitable source to assess social care outcomes at a \emph{national}
level however, as with many forms of routine administrative data, a
number of limitations exist. The cross sectoral nature of some parts of
the data collection limits the types of statistical analysis that can be
applied with it. For example, if start and end dates of social care
receipt were recorded at the individual level, time-to-event (survival)
analysis could provide more robust findings on factors influencing
receipt of social care. As such simpler methods, such as logistic
regression used in chapter \ref{ch:res2}, are more suited to the nature
of the SCS.

As discussed in more detail in chapter \ref{ch:renfrew}, however, there
remains the issue of how well the \emph{home} care aspect of the SCS
represents the total number of individuals receiving care in any
financial year. Using presence or not in the SCS as a binary measure of
receipt of social care, such as analyses in chapter \ref{ch:res2},
misclassifies some individuals by indicating they have not received care
when in fact they would have done. As the discussion in chapter
\ref{ch:renfrew} identifies, the \textasciitilde60\% of individuals that
the SCS would have identified as receiving home care in the Renfrewshire
area is likely to be an underestimate of the coverage of total social
care for the models in chapter \ref{ch:res2} for two reasons.

Firstly, the analysis in chapter \ref{ch:renfrew} could not account for
mortality and therefore overall proportions include those that died in
the financial year prior to the census date. These individuals were
omitted from analysis in chapter \ref{ch:res2}, therefore a higher
proportion of individuals that survived to the census date will be
classified correctly.

Secondly, the Renfrewshire analysis did not estimate the proportion of
individuals who received home care \emph{and} community alarm or
telecare services. The extended data collection procedures applied to
the SCS from financial year 2013/14 onwards meant details of community
alarm and telecare users \emph{at any time in the financial year} were
included in the SCS. An unknown proportion of these individuals, already
included in the SCS, will also receive home care services at times not
overlapping the census week. In chapter \ref{ch:renfrew} such
individuals will have been counted as having being ``missed'' by the
census when in fact, due to their receipt of a telecare or alarm
service, were indeed captured.

Despite these limitations, the main finding of chapter \ref{ch:renfrew}
indicates a potential minimum coverage of the SCS. A further finding
suggests that individuals who receive social care and whose data are not
collected by the SCS are more likely to be recipients of shorter-term
care. These individuals are often in receipt of ``Reablement'' type
services which are intentionally short lived. A flag for reablement was
not available for the data linked for the PhD but will be collected as
part of future SCS collections. Coupled with the likely underestimate of
coverage discussed above, this finding suggests using the SCS as an
indicator of receipt of social care is likely to capture a large
majority of individuals receiving long-term care.

Whilst this is welcoming, further issues remain with use of the SCS that
limit the types of analyses that can be conducted. The lack of
consistent recording of a CHI number in SCS collection meant
probabilistic matching methods based on name, date-of-birth, gender, and
postcode were required in order to create indexes that could then link
the SCS to health records (more fully explained in section
\ref{sec:linkage}). Whilst this matching process produced good overall
results (91\% match rate nationally) and rates were consistent across
age, gender, and deprivation groups, there was large variation in match
rates at the local authority level (76.7\% - 98.5\% for 31 of 32 local
authorities). In effect, these variations introduce missing data not at
random and make comparison in rates of care across local authorities
problematic. Analysis in chapter \ref{ch:res2} attempted to overcome
this problem by creating two groups of data including local authorities
with above average match rates. Whilst this allows some appraisal of
variations in receipt of care at the local authority level, gaining a
national picture remains elusive.

Although these issues are important, and analyses must take account of
the limitations, the SCS remains an important resource in international
terms. Social care data for research is recognised to be of poorer
quality than health related data and often very difficult to link health
records in many countries (OECD/EU, 2013). Where linkages have been able
to be made, inclusion of measures of home-based social care are less
frequent (Spiers \emph{et al.}, 2018). This means that, regardless of
the limitations described above, the linked health and social care
dataset created for analysis in this PhD is an important resource for
research as it addresses both of these issues.

One final (incidental) finding that can be inferred from the analysis of
social care data in the Renfrewshire area, reported in chapter
\ref{ch:renfrew}, adds to the debate surrounding eligibility and
allocation of social care. As argued by Sharkey (2006, p.10) (quoted at
the beginning of section \ref{subsubsec:eligibility-uk}), eligibility
criteria can be seen as a form of rationing where ``\ldots{}\emph{need}
is equated with \emph{resources available}.'' Figure
\ref{fig:ren-hc-counts} shows that, whilst year-to-year variations are
discernible, the weekly variation in the number of individuals receiving
home care is remarkably stable. The deduction that a finite number of
home care spaces are available at any given time, and that termination
of one individual's care must occur before another's can start, seems
credible. Whilst this may have been anecdotally known previously, figure
\ref{fig:ren-hc-counts} provides some empirical evidence to the debate.

\subsection{Linked administrative data research}\label{sec:disc-admin-data}

As cross-sectoral data linkages remain a novel methodology for PhD
research, a number of issues relevant to the process of obtaining a
linked dataset are worthy of discussion to inform future funders or
researchers who wish to commission or undertake similar projects.

The most important of these is time. Whilst all doctoral research is
time-consuming, and often runs past deadline, projects utilising data
from multiple public bodies have extra barriers than more traditional
forms of research. Whilst the approvals process can seem overly robust
at first glance, it is an essential step in ensuring research of this
nature is conducted in a safe and legal manner. Nurturing a good
relationship with a designated research co-ordinator from eDRIS can
greatly assist in production of a research proposal that will meet the
requirements of the PBPP with few revisions in a timely manner.

The controlled data service offered by UBDC, although adding an extra
layer of approval for the project, was invaluable through the support of
a designated member of staff to assist in negotiating the complicated
approvals process. This is particularly important for PhD students where
previous experience in applying to RAC or PBPP is unlikely. Support of
this nature should be considered for all PhD researchers taking on new
projects.

In this PhD, one of the main aims was to identify what sort of social
care data existed that could be linked to health sources. Although the
SCS was quickly identified as the most suitable source, the decision as
to whether indexing to the NRS population spine would take place,
enabling linkage to health data, could only be taken by the Scottish
Government. This decision was made around about the beginning of the 2nd
year of study (Sept 2016) with actual indexing taking place
approximately one year after that. This had obvious repercussions for
other aspects of project management including data sharing agreements
and extraction of cohort data (a full timeline is shown in figure
\ref{fig:timeline}). Future PhD projects would benefit from using
previously used data sources or data for which access has already been
negotiated.

The delay in obtaining linkable SCS data highlights a major temporal
obstacle for those carrying out similar types of research; namely the
lack of control over the completion of key project factors. Where data
sources come from public sector organisations, even those with excellent
infrastructure to enable data sharing such as ISD, extraction of project
data is one of many tasks the organisation's analysts will be dealing
with. Where university lawyers are required to write and amend data
sharing agreements, the project contract is one of many important
documents on their desk. Where data is being shared from a local
authority, unexpected events, such as an unanticipated general election,
mean staff designated to prepare and extract study data are unable to do
so because of other, essential, work demands. The higher number of
organisations involved, the more delays occur. The cumulative effect
makes project management very difficult as the completion date for any
given task is an unknown quantity.

Further constraints to data linkage projects involve developing the
skill of undertaking analysis within a safe haven environment. Little
training or documentation is available to assist in gaining these skills
and much of it is done by trial-and-error. Efficiency of the national
safe haven could be improved if stakeholders (e.g.~eDRIS, Research
Institutes, and the Scottish Government) could arrange some simple
training for future users. This could include subjects such as: access
procedures, software, maintenance, and statistical disclosure control
(SDC) - reducing unnecessary queries and data output requests not
conforming to SDC requirements.

A further efficiency saving in terms of SDC could be achieved through
improved practices in the appraisal of work by PhD students and their
supervisors. Over 600 items were cleared through SDC procedures for the
purposes of this thesis with the potential for more relating to
associated academic publications. This number could be greatly reduced
if, where remote access to the safe haven has been granted, an agreed
format for sharing and commenting on draft findings was agreed from
\emph{within} the safe haven (e.g.~Markdown reports in html with
comments in a separate MS Word document).

A final point, particularly for those conducting analysis, is to be
aware of the software being used and the way in which it is updated
within the safe haven. Analysis for this thesis was predominantly
conducted using the R language for statistical programming. This
software is exceptionally versatile and benefits from constant
development via an open source community of programmers. However,
without internet access, updating packages to preferred versions can be
cumbersome. This process has changed, and greatly improved, over the
lifetime of the PhD with a total CRAN mirror now being updated on an
almost monthly basis, but researchers should be aware of the limitations
of this approach.

\section{Comparisons to Previous Research}\label{sec:discuss-comparisons}

This is the first study, to the author's knowledge, that has aimed
specifically identified relationships between multimorbidity and
requirement for social care. Much previous research has focussed on the
effect social care has as an explanatory variable on other outcomes -
usually in a secondary care setting. Whilst multimorbidity may also be
included as an explanatory variable in these studies e.g.~(Condelius
\emph{et al.}, 2008), the relationship between them is not explored. The
positive, increasing effect of multimorbidity status on both social care
receipt and unplanned hospital admission found in this thesis (and by
Condelius \emph{et al.} (2008)) indicates that it is a common driver for
the use of both services.

The lack of use of home-based care as an independent variable in
research focussing on secondary care outcomes had been identified as a
gap in knowledge by Spiers \emph{et al.} (2018) in their systematic
review. Analysis in chapter \ref{ch:res2} addresses this omission.
Contrary to the overall findings of the systematic review, the analysis
suggests receipt of social care carried an increased probability of
admission. This is likely due to the requirement for a high level of
need to be deemed eligible to receive social care.

This finding supports those of other studies that linked social care
data at the individual level (Condelius \emph{et al.}, 2008; Bardsley
\emph{et al.}, 2012). Both these studies also found those in receipt of
social care utilised a higher proportion of secondary care services. The
large, population nature of the cohort in this thesis addresses the
limitations of these studies which each included data from only four
local authority areas and could potentially be unrepresentative of wider
populations. The models fitted to each financial year of data in section
\ref{sec:res3-usc} included an average of 864,500 (to the nearest 500)
individuals from 31 of Scotland's 32 local authorities. As such, the
data is nationally representative across all sociodemographic factors.

Models in section \ref{sec:res3-usc} indicated, for later years, that
those living in a care home had a lower probability of an unplanned
hospital admission than those that were not. As mentioned in previous
discussion, this finding should be treated with some caution. The
reliability of the care home flag in CHI datasets has been shown to lack
sensitivity and as such may underestimate the number of care home
residents (Burton \emph{et al.}, 2019). Furthermore, there is no obvious
reason why the direction of the effect on unplanned admission changes
from 2014/15 onwards. Overall numbers in the cohort with a positive
value for the care home flag decreased by over 8000 from 2011/12 to
2015/16 (table \ref{tab:results1-cohorttab}). This is a gradual
decrease, however, and unlikely to be the cause of effect change

Both Spiers \emph{et al.} (2018) and Bardsley \emph{et al.} (2012)
reported findings regarding the effect of being resident in a care homes
on secondary care outcomes. The former found, by pooling results from
studies using aggregate data, that an increase in the availability of
care home beds was associated with fewer admissions, delayed discharges,
and reduced length of stay. The latter found that those resident in a
care home were less likely to have a hospital admission than those
receiving intense levels of home care. Spiers \emph{et al.} (2018)
rightly identify the challenges of heterogeneity in data applied to the
methodological approach they employed. Of their 12 included studies,
only three were used to pool estimates on outcomes related to care
homes. Bardsley \emph{et al.} (2012), and analysis in section
\ref{sec:res3-usc}, omitted individuals who died in the year prior to
the study period of interest. Those in the final year of life are likely
to have at least one hospital admission (Moore \emph{et al.}, 2018)
which could affect results of models where these individuals are
omitted. As such, conclusions can not be accurately drawn regarding the
effect of care home admission on secondary care outcomes.

The use of a count of prescriptions as a proxy measurement of
multimorbidity (as discussed in section \ref{subsec:mm-measures}) has
been previously shown to be a good predictor of health care use (Perkins
\emph{et al.}, 2004; Brilleman and Salisbury, 2013; Wallace \emph{et
al.}, 2016). The use of grouped repeat medicine counts in chapter
\ref{ch:res2} show marked changes in partial effects in the receipt of
social care and unplanned admission across groups. This adds to the
argument that a count of medicines can act as useful proxy where disease
data is unavailable.

Of course, the specific method of how prescriptions are counted could
have an effect on these measures. Comparing the way in which medicines
were counted in chapter \ref{ch:res2} to other research is difficult
given differing exposure periods and cohort profiles used. However,
figures \ref{fig:results1-meds-hist}, \ref{fig:results1-meds-age-grp},
and \ref{fig:results1-meds-simd-age} show distribution patterns broadly
similar to figure 1 in Brilleman \& Salisbury (2013) and figure 1 in
Guthrie \emph{et al.} (2015) (when focussing on the 65 plus age group
only). Another study, using a similar age profile and aiming to identify
inappropriate prescribing from PIS data (Barnett \emph{et al.}, 2011),
found a higher percentage of individuals with at least one prescription
compared to results in table \ref{tab:results1-cohorttab} (94\% v 89\%).
This is likely due to the two-year exposure period employed in the
former study compared to (repeated) one-year exposure in this thesis.

\section{Strengths and Limitations}

\subsection{Strengths}

The study is the first, in a UK setting, to link health data to social
care records at a national level. The main strength of the research
carried out is in the size of dataset created to answer the designated
research questions. By creating a non-selective study population of all
individuals over the age of 65 in Scotland during the study period
(\textasciitilde1.1 million individuals) and linking their data from a
number of different health and social care sources, a comprehensive
description of this group has been provided. It is the first study to
specifically investigate the relationship between multimorbidity and
social care use. As such, the findings offer important insights for
clinicians and policy-makers alike.

The use of individual-level data is another important strength of this
research. Previous studies investigating the interaction between health
and social care services relied on aggregate statistics, often at local
authority or higher level, to estimate outcomes. These studies are
unable to account for individual characteristics that can have an
important role in such interactions.

The handful of previous cross-sectoral studies that have used
individual-level data have been limited to using social care data from
no more than a handful of local authorities at a time e.g.~(Condelius
\emph{et al.}, 2008; Bardsley \emph{et al.}, 2012). The large resource
in this PhD, despite the limitations discussed in the next section and
section \ref{sec:disc-sc-data}, mean concerns of sampling bias or
external validity have been reduced.

The quality of the dataset created for the thesis is demonstrated in its
inclusion as part of the Administrative Data Research Centre for
Scotland's successful phase 2 funding bid to the Economic and Social
Research Council. The bid outlined areas where, pending required
approvals, future research utilising this data could be conducted and
the process of applying recommendations in Section
\ref{sec:discuss-recs} has already begun.

Whilst the proportion of individuals receiving home care that were
captured by the SCS was previously unknown, analysis in chapter
\ref{ch:renfrew} has provided the first estimation of this value.
Despite limitations in the data available from Renfrewshire council, the
finding that those missing from the census are likely to be in receipt
of short-term care is important. This validation of the SCS enables
results of analysis with the linked dataset to be interpreted with more
confidence than if it had not been done.

In terms of analysis, the use of Average Partial Effects as a means of
interpreting logistic regression models allows comparison of effect
magnitudes between variables within models and across models. These
comparisons offer valuable insights that could not be considered by
reporting odds-ratios or variable probabilities alone. This method also
enables coefficients for interaction effects to be included in
predicting probabilities (and variable marginal effects) without
incurring the problems (discussed in section \ref{sec:methods-stats}) of
misinterpreting the coefficients themselves.

\subsection{Limitations}\label{sec:discuss-limits}

A number of limitations to this research have already been discussed,
particularly in sections \ref{sec:disc-sc-data} and
\ref{sec:discuss-comparisons}. However, there remain other general
limitations which will be further explored in this section.

All analyses carried out in this thesis are conducted using
observational data. All findings demonstrate associations between
variables only. Time and data quality issues restricted the ability of
applying methods from which causal inferences could be drawn. It is also
possible, as with all observational research, that unobserved
confounding variables could have an important role to play in outcome
effects.

Of these, the lack of a measure of living arrangements is one of the
most regrettable. Those living alone are more likely to require formal
social care, indeed officially reported statistics from the SCS suggest
55\% of those over 65 receiving home care live alone
(Scottish-Government, 2017e). Inclusion of this measurement in
statistical models could, therefore, potentially account for further
variation in receipt of care. This figure, however, is based on
approximately 60\% of SCS respondents, data was missing for the
remainder. Coupled with added attrition in the linkage process and the
likelihood of missingness not at random (i.e.~some local authorities not
returning this data at all), this available measurement was not of
sufficient quality to confidently include in analyses. Potential
solutions would involve expanding the data linkage to include UK census
data which includes a measure of home circumstances. This would,
however, involve significant amendments to approved permissions granted
by PBPP.

The research presented in the thesis exclusively focusses on
\emph{formal} social care provided by the state. The provision of
\emph{informal} social care (by family and friends) has a major role to
play in debates regarding health and social care service use. By its
very nature, informal care remains particularly difficult to capture in
administrative records (again the UK census offers potential). As such
inclusion in projects such as this PhD remain elusive. This is also true
of privately arranged social care. The ability of more affluent
individuals to purchase social care has potential to influence unplanned
hospital care although administrative records of such care are unlikely
to exist.

Another unobserved measure that could be useful in this area is one of
\emph{frailty} or \emph{need}. The associations found between
multimorbidity and service use in analyses could potentially be
explained, partially at least, by individual levels of frailty or need.
The definition of frailty remains a matter of some debate (Azzopardi
\emph{et al.}, 2018) (much in the same way as the definition of
multimorbidity discussed in chapter \ref{ch:lit-review}), and the terms
are often used synonymously. No standardised measure of frailty is
collected in administrative data at a national level in Scotland. A
measure of need, The indicator of Relative Need (ioRN2) score (ISD,
2017c), was developed in Scotland would be a very useful measurement in
this regard. However, the lack of mandatory assessment means few local
authorities return data with an ioRN2 score to the SCS. Early analysis
of PhD data showed over 90\% of records had a missing value for ioRN2
score and the variable was therefore dropped from analysis. Good
completion of this variable could have enabled more detailed
investigation into the presence or not of the inverse care law in social
care receipt.

Further limitations include the statistical analysis employed to find
results. The delivery of data for the linkage project was completed in
February 2018. Given the size of each dataset (e.g.~social care,
demographics, prescriptions etc.) and the complexity of wrangling data
into a suitable format, the time available for data exploration and
analysis was limited within the life-time of the PhD. Results presented
provide an excellent description of the linked data and identify
important variables and relationships regarding stated research
questions. This analysis provides an excellent platform for further
understanding. It did not, however, take advantage of the longitudinal
nature of the data. Despite social care data being of a cross sectional
nature, repeated measures for individuals are available. Start and stop
dates for all episodes of unscheduled care are available. Time-to-event
analysis is but one potential method that could be applied to this data
to provide more robust results, particularly regarding unplanned
admission where logistic regression models had a poor fit to the data.

\section{Recommendations for future research}\label{sec:discuss-recs}

As discussed in section \ref{sec:discuss-limits}, creation of the linked
data consumed a large part of the time available during the PhD. The
results presented in chapters \ref{ch:results-1} and \ref{ch:res2},
whilst providing a detailed description of the data, offer only a
glimpse of potential lines of enquiry that could be followed using this
resource. The most pertinent of these, related to the aims and
objectives of the thesis, are discussed in this section.

The first, examination of longitudinal changes in social care and
unscheduled care use, has already been discussed in section
\ref{sec:discuss-limits}. The size and depth of data available provides
an excellent platform to provide a more in-depth understanding of the
provision and factors influencing receipt of social care as well as its
interactions with unscheduled health care. Future analyses should take
advantage of the depth of information available and, where possible,
attempt to draw causal inferences about the effects of social care on
unscheduled health care use.

Better understanding may also be found by further utilising the
granularity of social care data. A simple yes/no measure of receipt was
used in analysis in chapters \ref{ch:results-1} and \ref{ch:res2}.
Variables measuring intensity of home care (via a value of weekly hours
of home care received) and whether an individual received a community
alarm or other telecare service are available. Both these measures may
have interesting effects on outcomes that remain unexplored.

There remains more data within the unscheduled care data mart that has
not been investigated. Unplanned hospital admission was studied for this
project but data on attendance at A \& E, GP out-of-hours service, NHS24
use, and ambulance service use is also available. Myriad insights
relating to the interaction of these services with each other,
demographics, multimorbidity, and social care are possible.

Another important factor, related to both social care and USC, is
mortality. Death records are also included in the linkage cohort. There
has been a recent increase in interest regarding outcomes for
individuals in their last months of life e.g.~hospital use (Moore
\emph{et al.}, 2018; Bardsley \emph{et al.}, 2019), out-of-hours primary
care (Brettell \emph{et al.}, 2018), and medication use (Curtin \emph{et
al.}, 2018). All of these topics could be investigated further with the
PhD dataset which would also have the benefit of a larger cohort and a
wider set of explanatory variables to choose from than seen in any one
of these studies, including aspects relating to social care which are
absent from all.

Whilst variations in the linkage rate at the local authority level of
SCS records to the CHI population spine is problematic, results found in
this thesis warrant further investigation. The difference in
probabilities of receiving care across council areas with similar
linkage rates raises questions regarding eligibility criteria and the
inverse care law. Understanding whether these variations are due to data
quality, natural variation, or unfairness in the system is of vital
importance to policy debates.

Future research should also employ other methods of measuring
multimorbidity. Alternative measures such as a count of the number of
chapters of the BNF an individual has prescriptions from (as a proxy for
body systems), or modelling the count of repeat medicines as a
continuous, rather than categorical, variable may add to the
understanding of relationships with outcomes. Where research only
involves individuals who used USC, disease data in the form of ICD-10
codes is available. These can be used to created comorbidity scores from
indices described in section \ref{subsec:mm-measures} and could be
cross-referenced with medicine counts.

Finally, linkage to other data sources should be considered. UK census
data contains variables that could greatly add to understanding in the
areas covered by this thesis e.g.~by identifying individuals who lived
alone or had an informal carer. The potential to link to primary care
data should also be explored. Interactions between primary care and
social care use remain largely unknown in a research context. This is an
important area to explore given the findings from this thesis of the
relationship between multimorbidity and social care. Data from GP
surgeries offers a more comprehensive ability to measure multimorbidity
than is available from current data collections and could greatly
improve understanding in this field.

\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
\thispagestyle{empty}

Multimorbidity is increasing in prevalence worldwide and has important
implications for clinicians, policymakers, and health research. Almost
completely absent from guidelines and literature regarding
multimorbidity is acknowledgement of its relationship with social care.
In the past, this has partly been due to a lack of good quality social
care data that could be linked to health records. Social care is an
important issue for policy-makers, particularly in Scotland where health
and social care services have recently been formally integrated. Given
presence of the ``inverse care law'' in primary care in Scotland,
understanding the influence of multimorbidity on receipt of social care
and whether inequity in access to service is present are important
research and policy questions.

The aims of this thesis were to:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Identify the best source of social care data in Scotland that can be linked to health data at an individual level (ideally in a national context) and assess its suitability for research
\item Create a linked dataset that can be used to answer questions relevant to multimorbidity and the provision of health and social care services 
\item Demonstrate the ability of this dataset to answer pertinent cross-sectoral questions by undertaking analysis to explore the associations between multimorbidity, social care, and unplanned hospital admission.
\end{enumerate}

Collected annually by the Scottish Government, the Social Care Survey
was deemed the best potential source of social care data to fulfil the
other aims of the project. Following indexing work completed by the
National Records of Scotland to map social care data to a population
spine, the survey was linked to three administrative health data
sources; prescribing records, unscheduled care records, and demographic
records including deaths. This was done with approval from the Public
Benefit and Privacy Panel.

A cohort was created including all individuals over the age of 65 in
Scotland between the 1st of April 2011 and the 31st of August 2016 and
all administrative records from the above sources for these individuals
were collated. After data cleaning 1,100,675 individuals were included.
Individuals from Clackmannanshire local authority area
(\textasciitilde10,000, the smallest mainland local authority) were not
included in analysis due to poor linkage rates of social care data to
the population spine.

Given the paucity of morbidity data at a national level. prescribing
records were used to create a proxy measurement of multimorbidity.
Social care measurement was defined as presence in the Social Care
Survey at the end of each financial year. Unplanned admission to
hospital was defined as at least one admission in the six months
following the end of each financial year.

Separate analysis based on ten years of social care data from
Renfrewshire council area was used to validate the home care aspect of
the Social Care Survey which is collected during a census week of each
year only. The results from this analysis suggest 60\% of individuals
receiving home care in each financial year are captured by the SCS.
These individuals receive approximately 75\% of all home care delivered
by the council. Those missed by the census are more likely to be in
receipt of short-term packages of home care. These results likely
underestimate the proportion of home care users captured by the census.
Data on deaths and change of address (e.g.~to a care home) were not
available for this analysis leading to some misclassification.
Furthermore, home care accounts for approximately 40\% of all
individuals over the age of 65 in the Social Care Survey. Other
information, such as community alarm and telecare receipt, accounts for
a greater proportion of all receipt and may include unmeasured overlap
with home care users in the survey. This separate analysis suggests,
overall, the Social Care Survey captures a large proportion of all
social care users.

The main analysis was aimed at answering two research questions:

In people over the age of 65 in Scotland:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item What are the socioeconomic, demographic, and multimorbidity patterns in the use of social care? 
\item Is there an association between receipt of social care and multimorbidity status. Does this vary by the patterns described in 1(a)?  
\end{enumerate}
\item Is there an association between unplanned hospital admission, multimorbidity, and the receipt of social care?
\end{enumerate}

In relation to question 1(a), results indicated increasing age, female
sex, lower socioeconomic position, and more severe multimorbidity status
were associated with higher rates of social care receipt. After
adjustment for other variables, some small variation in the rate of
social care delivered across local authorities was observed. However,
poor data quality and lack of multi-level modelling mean robust
conclusions regarding receipt of care across council areas cannot be
drawn. Nevertheless, it can be reported that no obvious evidence of an
``inverse social care law'' has been found at present.

Answering question 1(b), A strong association between multimorbidity and
receipt of social care was found. Those in the highest multimorbidity
group had a 15\% increased probability of receiving social care compared
to those with little or no multimorbidity. This finding addresses a gap
in current literature and indicates wider implications for society due
to the increasing prevalence of multimorbidity than has previously been
described.

Results of analysis aimed at answering question 2 indicate that both
multimorbidity and receipt of social care are associated with unplanned
hospital admission. Whilst the association of multimorbidity and
secondary care use has been comprehensively described elsewhere, few
studies have described the positive association with social care. This
is an important finding and adds to the debate about integration of
health and social care service which aims, among other things, to reduce
unplanned hospital admissions. The ``intensification'' of social care
services since 2010 means those in receipt of social care are those with
highest needs and are likely to continue to require multiple health and
social care services. Whether wider provision of social care to those
with less severe needs would have any meaningful reductions in rates of
unplanned hospital admission is unknown.
