\subsection{Setting and cohort}\label{subsec:setting-cohort}

Scotland has a population of around 5.4 million people. Health care has been delivered via 14 territorial health boards whilst social care falls withing the remit of the 32 local authorities. Since 2016, health and social care services have been integrated and 31 Integrated Joint Boards (IJBs) have been created. 

The cohort included all individuals in Scotland born before 31st March 1951 and alive during the study period 1st April 2011 to 31st March 2016. This identified all those over the age of 65 (and those turning 65 during the study period). Data for the cohort was extracted from the research population spine held by NRS with CHI numbers allowing linkage to other datasets.

\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

As figure \ref{fig:methods-linkage} shows, linkage keys from the extracted cohort were sent by an eDRIS coordinator to various health and social care data sources for extraction of information relating to any of these indivudals in the target data source. Specific variables requested, the time period they were requested over, and cleaning and wrangling of these data sources is described in the following section. 

**Figure needs tidied up and should show datasets in same order as following subsections**

The aim of cleaning and wrangling was to create one row of data for each indivudal for each financial year (1st April - 31st March) of the study period. This format is based on the principals of tidy data [@RN553].  Financial years were chosen as the time period of interest because the social care survey reports home care usage in a census week which is usually at the end of March. As each raw data file provided was in differing formats, this required differing approaches and relied heavily on data manipulation software packages \texttt{tidyr} v0.7.2 [@RN524], \texttt{dplyr} v0.7.4 [@RN283], \texttt{lubridate} v1.6.0 [@RN522], \texttt{stringr} v1.2.0 [@RN554], and \texttt{forcats} v0.2.0 [@RN521] in the R language and environment for statistical computing version 3.4.0 [@RN295] via the Integrated Development Environment RStudio v1.0.143 [@RN498].

\subsection{Demographic, geographic, and deaths information}\label{subsubsec:nrs-summs}


\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Demographic file data}
\label{tab:demos}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Number of rows & Number of individuals & Variables \\ \midrule
1,348,310 & 1,134,445 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Index, year/month of birth, year/month of death\\ Sex, Address start date, Address end date, Care home flag,\\ Previous Local Authority, Current Local Authority, \\ Current Health Board, SIMD decile\end{tabular} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}%
}
\end{table}

Demographic information for all eligible indiviudals identified from the population spine was extracted by the Public Health and Intelligence: Strategic Business Unit at NSS. This was joined with a flag variable indicating if an individual was resident in a care home (from prescribing data) in a single file which was made available in the national safe haven. SIMD decile was assigned as per the most recent version of the area-based measure (2016). The number of observations, individuals, and the differing variables in this raw demographic file are shown in table \ref{tab:demos}. 

As the table indicates some individuals had more than one row of information indicating multiple addresses during the study period (and thus potential multiple values for local, authority, health board, care home flag, and SIMD decile). Financial year time intervals were created for each financial year using the \texttt{lubridate} software package [@RN522]. Dummy variables were then created indicating the age, local authority of residence, health board of residence, and simd decile during each financial year (with null values where not applicable). The variables were then gathered to long format in order to reshape the data to include one row of data per individual per financial year. Where and individual had multiple addresses during one fininacial year, the most recent value for local authority, health board, and SIMD decile was used. This resulted in a dataframe of 7,775,410 observations pertaining to 1,134,445 individuals.

\subsection{Social Care Survey}\label{subsubsec:scs-summs}

Data from the Scottish Care Surveys 2010 - 2016 (including separate Home Care Census and Self-Directed Support surveys for earlier years) were extracted by a Scotish Government analyst and transferred to the national safe haven in a single file. There were a number of variables indicating the weekly hours of home care (if any) each indiviudal received, whether they were provided by the local authority or and independent orgainsation, and whether these hours indicated the scheduled hours of home care or the actual number of hours delivered. There is some discrepency between local authorities on which value (scheduled, or actual) of home care is returned to the Scottish Government for the SCS. Some authorities return scheduled only, others actual hours only, and yet others return both values. The SCS reports statistics based on the actual hours of home care delivered where available and uses the scheduled value where it is not. This convention was also used for the purposes of this thesis. 

Many variables requested from the SCS had large amounts of missing data. There were also coding issues with extra values present that had no corresponding description in the provided metadata. Table \ref{tab:scs-vars} lists the variables included and excluded after data cleaning. 

Assessment for duplicated rows indicated 4,357 individuals had more than one row of data for some years of data. Inspection of these additional rows indicated a change in value for some variables (e.g. a flag indicating use of community alarm services postive in one row and negative in another, or different values for client group in multiple rows). These additional rows amounted to 1.1% of observations in the SCS. Once joined to other datasets (as described in section \ref{subsec:join-data}), all observations for the years of data where there were duplicates were dropped from the dataset.

\subsection{Prescribing Information Service}\label{subsec:pis-summs}

Community prescribing information for all individuals in the cohort were extracted from the Prescribing Information System (PIS) by analysts from ISD. For each quarter of the study period (Quarter 1 2010/11 to Quarter 4 2015/16) a list of medicines prescribed to each indiviudal was extracted and transferred in one file to the national safe haven. This file contained 134,377,877 observations of four variables: The financial year and quarter, the BNF subsection code, The approved name of the medicine, and a count of how many times the medicine was prescribed in the quarter. Coding errors were found in 138,973 observations (wrong number of digits in the BNF subsection or characters found in the count variable) and these were dropped from analysis. 

The count of medicines was based on the BNF classes included in a count of polypharmacy by Guthrie et al [@RN274]. The additional material provided online with this paper included a table of included drugs. This table was ammended to remove BNF subsections 3.9.1, 3.9.2, and 13.9. The latter section includes different forms of shampoos whilst the former 2 sections include preperations for coughs. These were not deemed necessary to be included in overall counts. Two BNF subsections not included in the Guthrie et al table were deemed important to include as testing revealed large numbers of prescriptions included medicines from these sections would have been omitted otherwise. These sections were 2.2.4 (Potassium sparing diuretics with other diuretics) and 2.2.8. (Diuretics with potassium). In total, 198 medicines listed in the BNF were not included and rows with these medicines were removed from the PIS file. A full list of these medicines is shown in Appendix F. Table \ref{tab:dropped-meds} shows the cleaning process. 

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}

BNF sections 3.9.1, 3.9.2, \& 13.9 & 645,900 & 132,165,361 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

A summary measure for each indiviudal was created counting the total number of medicines prescribed in each financial year. To be eligible in the count, a medicine had to be prescribed in at least 2 quarters of each financial year. This meant one-off prescriptions, such as antibiotics for a transient infection, were not included in the overall count. An indiviudal could thus have a maximum of 6 observations, one for each financial year. A second count was created totalling the number of chapters of the BNF that each individual had medicines prescribed from as a crude measure of body systems requiring medication. Table \ref{tab:PIS-clean} shows the total observations and variables in the cleaned PIS file.
