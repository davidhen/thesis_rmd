\subsection{Setting and cohort}\label{subsec:setting-cohort}

Scotland has a population of approximately 5.4 million people. Health care is delivered via 14 territorial health boards whilst social care falls within the remit of 32 local authorities. Since 2016, health and social care services have been integrated and 31 Integrated Joint Boards (IJBs) have been created. 

The cohort included all individuals in Scotland born before 31st March 1951 and alive during the study period 1st April 2011 to 31st March 2016. This identified all those over the age of 65 (and those turning 65 during the study period). Data for the cohort was extracted from the research population spine held by NRS with CHI numbers allowing linkage to other datasets. Background information on these datasets is described in chapter \ref{ch:data}.

\end{figure}
\end{landscape}

As figure \ref{fig:methods-linkage} shows, linkage keys from the extracted cohort were sent by an eDRIS coordinator to various health and social care data sources for extraction of information relating to any of these individuals in the target data source. Specific variables requested, the time period they were requested over, and cleaning and wrangling of these data sources is described in the following section. 

The aim of cleaning and wrangling was to create one row of data for each individual for each financial year (1st April - 31st March) of the study period. This format is based on the principals of tidy data [@RN553].  Financial years were chosen as the time period of interest because the social care survey reports home care usage in a census week which is usually at the end of March. As each raw data file provided was in differing formats, this required differing approaches and relied heavily on data manipulation software packages \texttt{tidyr} v0.7.2 [@RN524], \texttt{dplyr} v0.7.4 [@RN283], \texttt{lubridate} v1.6.0 [@RN522], \texttt{stringr} v1.2.0 [@RN554], \texttt{forcats} v0.2.0 [@RN521], \texttt{data.table} v1.10.4 [@RN555], and \texttt{zoo} v1.8-0 [@RN556] in the R language and environment for statistical computing version 3.4.0 [@RN295] via the Integrated Development Environment RStudio v1.0.143 [@RN498].

\subsection{Demographic, geographic, and deaths information}\label{subsubsec:nrs-summs}

Demographic information for all eligible individuals identified from the population spine was extracted by the Public Health and Intelligence: Strategic Business Unit at NSS. This was joined with a flag variable indicating if an individual was resident in a care home (from prescribing data) in a single file which was made available in the national safe haven. SIMD decile was assigned as per the most recent version of the area-based measure [@RN238]. The number of observations, individuals, and the differing variables in this raw demographic file are shown in table \ref{tab:demos}. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Demographic file data}
\label{tab:demos}
\resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Number of rows & Number of individuals & Variables \\ \midrule
1,348,310 & 1,134,445 & \begin{tabular}[c]{@{}l@{}}Index, year/month of birth, year/month of death\\ Sex, Address start date, Address end date, Care home flag,\\ Previous Local Authority, Current Local Authority, \\ Current Health Board, SIMD decile\end{tabular} \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}%
}
\end{table}

As the table indicates, some individuals had more than one row of information indicating multiple addresses during the study period (and thus potential multiple values for local, authority, health board, care home flag, and SIMD decile). Financial year time intervals were created for using the \texttt{lubridate} software package [@RN522]. Dummy variables were then created indicating the age, local authority of residence, health board of residence, and SIMD decile during each financial year (with null values where not applicable). The variables were then gathered to long format in order to reshape the data to include one row of data per individual per financial year. Where an individual had multiple addresses during one financial year, the most recent value for local authority, health board, and SIMD decile was used. This resulted in a data frame of 7,775,410 observations pertaining to 1,134,445 individuals.

\subsection{Social Care Survey}\label{subsubsec:scs-summs}

Data from the Scottish Care Surveys 2010 - 2016 (including separate Home Care Census and Self-Directed Support surveys for earlier years) were extracted by a Scottish Government analyst and transferred to the national safe haven in a single file. There were a number of variables indicating the weekly hours of home care (if any) each individual received, whether they were provided by the local authority or and independent organisation, and whether these hours indicated the scheduled hours of home care or the actual number of hours delivered. There is some discrepancy between local authorities on which value (scheduled, or actual) of home care is returned to the Scottish Government for the SCS. Some authorities return scheduled only, others actual hours only, and yet others return both values. The SCS reports statistics based on the actual hours of home care delivered where available and uses the scheduled value where it is not. This convention was also used for the purposes of this thesis. 

Many variables requested from the SCS had large amounts of missing data. There were also coding issues with extra values present that had no corresponding description in the provided metadata. Variables with these issues were dropped and not included in analyses. Table \ref{tab:scs-vars} lists the variables included and excluded after data cleaning. 

A small fraction of observations (198 pertaining to 129 individuals) had an impossible value of weekly hours of home care greater than 168 hrs (more than 24hr-7-day-a-week care). These records were dropped from the dataset.

Assessment for duplicated rows indicated 4,357 individuals had more than one row of data for some years of data. Inspection of these additional rows indicated a change in value for some variables (e.g. a flag indicating use of community alarm services positive in one row and negative in another, or different values for client group in multiple rows). These additional rows amounted to 1.1% of observations in the SCS. The exact cause of these duplications is unknown. One possible explanation is that duplication was created when records from different sources were joined together in advance of being sent for linkage. A further potential cause is the duplication of records created by the process of recycling identification numbers in some local authorities. Given the small percentage or records this affected, individuals with duplicated information were dropped from the dataset after being joined to other datasets (as described in section \ref{subsec:join-data}).

\subsection{Prescribing Information Service}\label{subsec:pis-summs}

Community prescribing information for all individuals in the cohort were extracted from the Prescribing Information System (PIS) by analysts from ISD. For each quarter of the study period (Quarter 1 2010/11 to Quarter 4 2015/16) a list of medicines prescribed to each individual was extracted and transferred in one file to the national safe haven. This file contained 134,377,877 observations of four variables: The financial year and quarter, the BNF subsection code, The approved name of the medicine, and a count of how many times the medicine was prescribed in the quarter. Coding errors were found in 138,973 observations (wrong number of digits in the BNF subsection or characters found in the count variable) and these were dropped from analysis. 

The count of medicines was based on the BNF classes included in a count of polypharmacy by Guthrie et al [-@RN274]. The additional material provided on-line with this paper included a table of included drugs. This table was amended to remove BNF subsections 3.9.1, 3.9.2, and 13.9. The latter section includes different forms of shampoos whilst the former 2 sections include preparations for coughs. These were not deemed necessary to be included in overall counts. Two BNF subsections not included in the Guthrie et al table were deemed important to include as testing revealed large numbers of prescriptions included medicines from these sections would have been omitted otherwise. These sections were 2.2.4 (Potassium sparing diuretics with other diuretics) and 2.2.8. (Diuretics with potassium). In total, 198 medicines listed in the BNF were not included and rows with these medicines were removed from the PIS file. A full list of these medicines is shown in Appendix G. Table \ref{tab:dropped-meds} shows the cleaning process. 

\begin{table}[h]

BNF sections 3.9.1, 3.9.2, \& 13.9 & 645,900 & 132,165,361 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

A summary measure for each individual was created counting the total number of repeat medicines prescribed in each financial year. To be eligible in the count, a medicine had to be prescribed in at least 2 quarters of each financial year. This meant one-off prescriptions, such as antibiotics for a transient infection, were not included in the overall count. A separate count was conducted for individuals who died in the first quarter of each financial year (and thus unable to have medicines prescribed in two quarters). The total number of unique medicines prescribed in the first quarter was used for these individuals. Each participant could thus have a maximum of 6 observations, one for each financial year. A second count was created totalling the number of chapters of the BNF that each individual had medicines prescribed from as a crude measure of body systems requiring medication. Table \ref{tab:PIS-clean} shows the total observations and variables in the cleaned PIS file.

\subsection{Unscheduled care measures}\label{subsec:usc-summs}

Unscheduled care information for all individuals included in the cohort was extracted from unscheduled care data mart (UCD) by an analyst from ISD. The raw file contained 3,772,402 observations from 845,893 individuals. Each observation related to a single continuous urgent care pathway (CUP) as described in section \ref{subsec:source-ucd}.

In a similar fashion as with the demographics data, dummy variables were created indicating if each observation occurred within financial years during the study period. This enabled data to be reshaped to a long format with individuals having one or multiple rows of data for each financial year. To create one observation per individual per year, data with information on each CUP was nested within a data frame as a list column as described by Wickham & Grolemund [-@RN557, ch.20]. With data in this format, summary measures were derived by applying functions to the list column utilising the \texttt{purrr} software package [@RN523]. Derived information included counts of total USC episodes, acute admissions to hospital, A & E attendances, and total number of long-term conditions identified from admissions and A & E data. The format of the cleaned UCD data frame is described in table \ref{tab:USC-clean}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Description of cleaned USC file}

\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
\toprule
Number of rows & Number of individuals & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Variables} \\ \midrule

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Data were available beyond the study period ending 31st March 2016. Records outside this end date were dropped when this file was joined with the other sources of data which is described in the next section.
