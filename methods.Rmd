\chapter{Methods}\label{ch:methods}


\section{Cohort}\label{sec:cohort}

The study cohort included all individuals in Scotland born before 31st March 1951 and alive during the study period 1st April 2011 to 31st March 2016. This identified all those over the age of 65 (and those turning 65 during the study period). Data for the cohort was extracted from the research population spine held by NRS with CHI numbers allowing linkage to other health datasets. 

\section{Linkage process}\label{sec:linkage}

\subsection{Social care linkage}\label{subsec:meth-soc-link}

Describe probabilistic match to population spine with rates for each local authority

\subsection{Linkage to health sources}
