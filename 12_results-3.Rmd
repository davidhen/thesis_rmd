\chapter{Results 3: Social care, multimorbidity, and unscheduled health care use}\label{ch:res-3}
\thispagestyle{empty}

This chapter reports results of an analysis conducted to answer research question 2 (link to section). As described in section \ref{stats-rq2}, receipt of unscheduled care was measured in three ways: presence of any unscheduled care episode in the unscheduled care data mart (including acute hospital admission, A & E, NHS24, GP OOH, or SAS), and specifically by any admission to hospital or attendance at A & E as outcomes in their own right.  

The chapter is split into three sections. The first reports descriptive statistics of receipt of unscheduled care for the whole cohort using financial year 2013/14 as a reference year. Plots showing the relationship between the receipt of unscheduled care and age, sex, deprivation status, and multimorbidity status are provided. 

The remaining sections report results of logistic regression models applied to each year of data for each of the three outcome measures. Contingency tables of each outcome measure by sociodemographic characteristics, model diagnostics in the form of goodness-of-fit tables, and plots depicting Average Partial Effects (APEs) for included independent variables are provided in each of these sections.  

\section{Overall Descriptive statistics}\label{sec:res3-descr}



\FloatBarrier
\section{Unplanned admission}\label{sec:res3-usc}

This section reports results of logistic regression models detailed in section \ref{stats-rq2}. The outcome variable in these models is receipt of any form of unscheduled care (A & E attendance, acute admission to hospital, NHS24, GP OOH, or SAS) in the six months after the end of each financial year. 

As seen in the previous chapter, a model is reported for each year of data from 2011/12 to 2015/16. The section is split into three subsections: a contingency table of descriptive statistics for the outcome variable is provided, followed by a table reporting goodness-of-fit measures for each model, before a final subsection with tables and plots detailing the APEs of each variable on the outcome. Where trends of results across years are similar, financial year 2013/14 is used as a reference in tables and plots.

\section{Acute admission to hospital}\label{sec:res3-adm}

This section reports results of logistic regression models detailed in section \ref{stats-rq2}. The outcome variable in these models is acute admission to hospital in the six months after the end of each financial year. 

The section follows the same format as presented in the previous section with the outcome variable being the only difference in analyses.

Table \ref{tab:res3adm-chars1314} shows a cross table of the cohort in 2013/14 with regard to the outcome variable. As seen in the previous section, there were a total of 868,947 individuals included in the model for this financial year. There was little difference between the percentage of males (9.2%) and females (9.1%) that were admitted to hospital during the outcome period and the difference between these groups was not statistically significant. A majority (55%) of those that died during the outcome period were admitted to hospital. An increase in the percentage of individuals being admitted to hospital is seen through age groups from 5.1% of those aged 65-69 to 20% of those aged 90-94 with a slight reduction in those aged over 95 (19.7%). Increases are also seen through multimorbidity groups from 3.6% for those prescribed 0-2 repeat medicines to 18.4% for those prescribed nine or more repeat medicines. Higher percentages of the population using social care (24.1%), unscheduled care in the year prior to the outcome period (18.7%), and those resident in care home (17.1%) had an admission in the outcome period compared to those not using these services (7.3%, 5.6%, and 8.9% respectively). The median value of SIMD (5, IQR 4) was lower than that for those with no admission (6, IQR 5).

Figure \ref{fig:res3-adm-APE} plots the APEs of each variable in each model and table \ref{tab:res3-adm-ape1314} shows the values of APEs for financial year 2013/14. As reported in models where any USC use is the outcome variable in the previous section, dying during the outcome period has the largest APE. This magnitude of this effect is, however, lower than seen in the previous section (34.6% increase in probability of admission compared to almost 60% increase in any USC use). High multimorbidity (nine or more repeat prescriptions) has the next highest positive APE, In 2013/14 this group had a 7.7% increase in probability in being admitted to hospital compared to those from the lowest group (0-2 repeat medicines). Those with 6-8 and 3-5 repeat medicines had increases in probability of admission of 3.5% and 1.6% respectively. Use of any form of unscheduled care in the year prior to the outcome period or receipt of social care during the SCS census week was associated with increases in the probability of admission to hospital in 2013/14 of 6.7% compared to those with no prior USC use and 6.0% for those with no social care receipt respectively. The was an incremental increase in APE through age groups from those aged 70-74 (0.7%) to those aged 90-94 (6.0%) compared to those age 65-69. Those aged 95 or above had a lower APE (5.4%) than their immediately younger age group.

There is a negative effect on admission to hospital for females compared to males with a difference in probability of 1.3%. This effect size is larger than seen in models where any form of USC was the outcome variable (section \ref{subsec:res3-usc-ape}). Living in a care home also had a negative effect on admission to hospital after controlling for other variables in the model. The APE in 2013/14 was -0.011 indicating a 1.1% decrease in the probability of admission to hospital for those living in a care home. This value increases over time and the most recent model shows a 3% decrease in probability of admission. 

Figure \ref{fig:res3-adm-simd} shows the conditional effect of SIMD on admission to hospital during the six months following financial year 2013/14. As SIMD was modelled as a continuous variable the APE of -0.003 represents the coefficient of the slope in figure ref at the average value of SIMD (5.6, SD 2.8). After adjusting for other variables the conditional effect of SIMD varies by only 1% across deciles (0.034 (95% CI 0.032-0.036) in decile 1 to 0.024(95% CI 0.023-0.025) in decile 10).

Table \ref{res3-adm-gof} shows the results of diagnostic tests for each model. The value of McFadden's $R^2$ decreases slightly over time from 0.147 to 0.142. Although values are lower than seen for social care models fitted in the previous chapter, they are slightly higher than found for models using any USC use reported in the previous section.
