# thesis_rmd

My PhD thesis - submitted August 2019. Viva passed 16th Dec 2019 with no corrections.

Knit THESIS.Rmd for pdf 

*Note* The .Rmd will not compile with the most recent versions of RStudio. I'm not exactly sure why, there are a million possible reasons. What is weird is that it *will* compile with a legacy version of RStudio, which can be downloaded from here https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206569407-Older-Versions-of-RStudio. I use version 1.1.463.

Because of this the thesis.pdf file in the root folder is only partially comnplete. You can find the final submitted version in the "submitted_for_rv" folder.
