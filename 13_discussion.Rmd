Given the broad scope of the research covered in the thesis, key findings and their implications are discussed in ? subsections. 

\subsection{Patterns in receipt of social care}\label{subsec:mm-sc-kfinds}

This analyses of patterns of social care use in Scotland is novel given its linkage of health and social care resources and has a number of findings and implications. The descriptive statistics in section \ref{sec:res1-sc} and the first set of models presented in chapter \ref{ch:res2} investigated the factors associated with receipt of social care. One important aspect was to identify if a relationship between multimorbidity and social care existed as this had been identified as a gap in existing empirical knowledge. The results indicate that such a relationship does indeed exist and that the effect of this relationship grows as the severity of multimorbidity (measured by grouped repeat medicine counts) increases. The change in probability of receiving social care for those in the highest multimorbidity group (prescribed nine-or-more repeat medicines) compared to those in the lowest group (prescribed 0-2 medicines) is approximately 15%. This change is approximately 6.5% and 3% for the 6-8 and 3-5 repeat medicine groups respectively.  

These results are broadly consistent across models applied to differing financial years of data. Subset 2 (including individuals from nine local authorities with a linkage rate of 92%-95.9%) showed slightly lower values of partial effects for all age, sex, and multimorbidity groups group compared to subset 1. This may be due to the larger size of subset 2 which included approximately 77,000 more individuals overall and less uncertainty for the lower numbers in smaller groups. Nevertheless, overall patterns are similar across both subsets. 

The use of partial (or marginal) effects to interpret logistic regression models allows comparison of effect sizes across variables and models after adjustment for all included independent variables [@RN563]. In both subsets of data, models across all years showed the partial effect of being in the highest multimorbid group compared to the lowest was of similar magnitude to that of being aged 80-84 compared to being aged 65-69. In other words, after adjustment for age, sex, and sociodemographic variables, being in the highest multimorbidity group is equivalent to being 10-15 years older than the baseline age group. 

The identification of the relationship between multimorbidity and social care use is important both for health clinicians and policy makers. High levels of multimorbidity have the potential to indicate need for social care which should be a consideration when assessing this patient group. Given the increasing prevelance of multimorbidty and the reduction in funding for social care (discussed in chapter \ref{ch:lit-review}), urgent consideration of social care provision and funding by policy-makers is warranted. 

This argument has further support given that social care receipt also has, unsurprisingly, an association with age. Given demographic trends, the demand for social care services is only likely to increase. Indeed, the only other measurements with higher magnitude of partial effects than the highest multimorbidity group were those related to higher age groups, particularly the three age groups in which those over 85 belonged to: 85-89, 90-94, and 95 plus. The magnitude of effects for these groups were particularly high indicating that, after adjustment for other model variables, being in these age groups was associated with approximately 29%, 42%, and 47% increased probability of receiving social care compared to those in the 65-69 age group respectively (again slightly lower effects were seen in subset 2). Standard errors were higher, and their associated 95% confidence intervals wider, for the two highest age groups than seen for other variables reflecting the lower overall numbers in these groups. Nevertheless, social care receipt has a strong relationship in age groups over 85 years which is likely to reflect higher levels of frailty. 

Unexpectedly, the effect of socioeconomic position, as measured by SIMD decile of residence, is negligible after adjusting for other variables in the models of both subsets. This is an important finding and suggests that the higher rates of social care receipt for those living in lower SIMD deciles shown in tables \ref{tab:res2-chars1516} and \ref{tab:res2-2-chars1516} are attenuated after adjustment for age, multimorbidity, sex, and local authority of residence. The likely reason for this can be discerned from the pattern shown in figure \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-1}. This shows that, apart from those in the highest multimorbidity group (9+ repeat medicines), the rate of care received in each group is more evenly spread across deprivation deciles - resulting in the small partial effect of SIMD decile in the models. This effect can be more easily discerend in figure \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-2} where rates of care \emph{within} each age/sex group are visualised.  The higher rates of social care receipt in lower SIMD deciles, therefore, are driven by those (particularly females) in the highest multimorbidity group. This would suggest care is concentrated on those with highest need reflecting the arguments of "intensification" discussed in chapter \ref{ch:lit-review}.  

Tables \ref{tab:res2-chars1516} and \ref{tab:res2-2-chars1516} both show higher percentages of females receiving social care compared to males whilst figure \ref{fig:results1-sc-demos} shows this pattern is consistent across all ages. Depsite this, the APE for being female is relatively small in models - 4% and 3.2% increased probability in subset 1 and 2 respectively. This suggests multimorbidity status attenuates some, but not all, of the higher rates of social care received by females - a pattern also visible in figure \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-2}. The remaining gap between sexes in social care receipt could potentially be explained by two reasons. Firstly, females may be more likely to live alone and therefore have greater need for social care in older age. Secondly, females may be more likely to provide, and less likely to receive, informal care to or from a partner. Whilst a variable for living arrangements is available in the SCS, there are high levels of missing data meaning it could not be accurately included in models. 

A final finding from the analysis on social care receipt is that variation between local authorities is also present. The differences in the probability of receiving social care of 6.2% between Na h-Eileanan Siar and South Ayshire in subset 2 (table \ref{tab:res2-model2-APE}) is comparable to the difference in probability between the second-highest multimorbidity group (6-8 repeat medicines) and it's reference group (0-2 repeat medicines). However, it must be noted this was the largest inter-council difference in subset 2 (the corresponding difference in subset 1 was 5%) and many APEs for councils were broadly similar. Given the variation in linkage rates across local authority areas, and the lack of multi-level modelling in analysis, robust conclusions about the effect of local authority of residence and receipt of social care cannot be drawn at present. Nevertheless, this is an important finding that warrants further exploration. 

In summary, the analysis indicates that social care receipt is driven primarily by age and multimorbidity stauts. These factors attenuate a large proportion of the greater rates of care delivered to females and those living in more deprived areas. The findings support the "intensification" description of social care provision and add evidence that care is concentrated on those with high levels of multimorbidity living in the poorest areas. Increasing prevelence of multimorbidity and the increasing proportion of the population in older age groups are likely to increase demand for social care services significantly.    

\subsection{Patterns in unplanned hospital admissions}

Descriptive statistics (section \ref{sec:res1-adm}) and models (section \ref{sec:res3-usc}) analysing factors associated with unplanned hospital admission in the six months after the end of each financial year reveal a relationship between multimorbidity and admission. Average Partial Effects increase with severity of multimorbidity, a pattern easily discernable from the change in colour by multimorbidity group in figure \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-3} and the more naive visualisation in figure \ref{fig:results1-adm-demos}. 

The magnitude of multimorbidity APEs, as for all variables, are much lower than seen in social care models. For example, compared with being in the lowest multimorbidity group (0-2 repeat medicines), being in the highest multimorbidity group (9 plus repeat medicines) increases the probability of unplanned admission by between 8% and 9% across models (compared to 13% - 15% increased probability of receiving social care). Nevertheless, multimorbidity is shown to have an important relationship with unplanned hospital admission.  

The increase in probability of admission of 6%-7% and 7%-8% for those that received social care or had previously used any form of unscheduled care (unplanned admission, A & E, GP OOH, NHS24 or Ambulance service) respectively, indicates those with hospital admissions are more likely to be high users of all health and social care services. This is an important finding indicating a cohort of very sick individuals interact with services in both health and social care services and may account for a large proportion of service demand.

One area where this may not be the case is for those that live in care homes although findings varied across models. The direction of effect on unplanned hospital admission for those living in a care home changes from 2014/15 onwards. In models fitted to earlier financial years, living in a care home has a small (<1%) increase in probablity of unplanned admission. Models fitted to data from 2014/15 and 2015/16 show a decreased probability of admission of almost 2%. It is difficult to ascertain the cause of this change. The obvious temporal difference could have a number of explanations including policy change or, more likely, change in data collection methods.     

An increase in APEs is also seen through age groups although this is not a linear pattern. The oldest age group (95 plus) has a lower APE point estimate than the next oldest (90-94) although larger confidence intervals, which overlap in all years, are present suggesting there is little difference in APE over the age of 90.   

The models fitted to identify factors associated with unplanned hospital admissions had a poor fit as measured by McFadden's pseudo $R^{2}$ in all years and, therefore, caution is required when interpreting results. There is the possibility that other unmeasured factors could improve model fit. It also notable that the magnitude of APEs are considerably smaller than seen for social care models suggesting more complex factors associated with unplanned hospital admission may exist.  

In summary, age and multimorbidity are shown to have relationships with unplanned hospital admission. Those that receive social care and those that have used unscheduled health care services in the financial year prior to the exposure period also have a higher probability of unplanned hospital admission. Caution is required in interpreting these results given the poorer fit to data found with logisitc regression models. 

\subsection{Health and social care interaction}

Although two different models were conducted in analysis, comparison of results (and descriptive statistics) presents cogent arguments to the debate on the interaction between health and social care services. 

Perhaps the most important comparison is between the heatmaps showing the overall distribution of social care and unplanned hospital admission presented in figures \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-1} and \ref{fig:results1-heatmap-3}. As previously discussed the former highlights the "intensification" of social care services focussed on, particularly female, highly multimorbid groups of lower socioeconomic position. Comparison to the latter figure shows the distribution of unplanned admission to hospital, whilst also affecting predominantely low SIMD decile residents with high multimorbidity, has a wider distribution affecting more males and younger age groups. If, as the policy of health and socal care integration explicitly aims to achieve, social care provision is to reduce the number of unplanned hospital admissions, then the distribution of the receipt of care will need to broaden to groups other than those over 80.

Given the strong effects increasing multimorbidity has on receipt of both social care and unplanned hospital admission (visible in heatmaps and model results), the results of analysis add weight to the many calls for a focus on preventative public health measures to attenuate the need for services. Compared to the highest multimorbidity group, those receiving 6-8 or 3-5 repeat medicines had much lower rates of unplanned admission and social care use. Those, even at older ages, in the lowest multimorbidity group (receiving 0-2 repeat medicines) had very little use of either service. Preventative measures that reduce the proportion of the population in the highest multimorbidity group could have a big impact on demand for health and social care services. 

Relevant to both these arguments is discussion regarding primary care (e.g. WHO [-@RN599] and section \ref{subsec:litrv-mm-context}) where universal coverage, despite issues with the inverse care law, is generally regarded as the most appropriate way of improving access to service in order to deliver effective (and preventative) care for those with multimorbidity. Whether universal coverage of social care could have the same effect, and potentially mitigate the need for unplanned admission, is a matter of debate. However, the current means-and-needs tested model of social care provision in the UK is unlikely to help in this regard. With a link established between multimorbidity and social care use, identifying interactions between primary care and social care use is now an important potential research avenue requiring exploration. 


\subsection{Social care data}\label{sec:disc-sc-data}

The first aim of the PhD was to identify what Scottish social care data sources existed that could be linked to health data and asses their suitablility for research purposes. The SCS was identified as the most suitable source to assess social care outcomes at a \emph{national} level however, as with many forms of routine adminsitrative data, a number of limitations exist. The cross sectoral nature of some parts of the data collection limits the types of statistical analysis that can be applied with it. For example, if start and end dates of social care receipt were recorded at the individual level, time-to-event (survival) analysis could provide more robust findings on factors influencing receipt of social care. As such simplar methods, such as logisitc regression used in chapter \ref{ch:res2}, are more suited to the nature of the SCS. 

As discussed in more detail in chapter \ref{ch:renfrew}, however, there remains the issue of how well the \emph{home} care aspect of the SCS represents the total number of individuals receiving care in any financial year. Using presence or not in the SCS as a binary measure of receipt of social care, such as analyses in chapter \ref{ch:res2}, misclassifies some individuals by indicating they have not received care when in fact they would have done. As the discussion in chapter \ref{ch:renfrew} identifies, the ~60% of individuals that the SCS would have identified as receiving home care in the Renfrewshire area is likely to be an underestimate of the coverage of total social care for the models in chapter \ref{ch:res2} for two reasons. 

Firstly, the analysis in chapter \ref{ch:renfrew} could not account for mortality and therefore overall proportions include those that died in the financial year prior to the census date. These individuals were omitted from analysis in chapter \ref{ch:res2}, therefore a higher proportion of individuals that survived to the census date will be classified correctly. 

Secondly, the Renfrewshire analysis did not estimate the proportion of individuals who received home care \emph{and} telecare services. The extended data collection procedures applied to the SCS from financial year 2013/14 onwards meant details of community alarm and telecare users \emph{at any time in the financial year} were included in the SCS. An unknown proportion of these individuals, already included in the SCS, will also receive home care services at times not overlapping the census week. In chapter \ref{ch:renfrew} such individuals will have been counted as having being "missed" by the census when in fact, due to their receipt of a telecare or alarm service, were indeed captured.

Despite these limitations, the main finding of chapter \ref{ch:refnrew} indicates a potential minimum coverage of the SCS. A further finding suggests that individuals who receive social care and whose data are not collected by the SCS are more likely to be recipients of shorter-term care. These individuals are often in receipt of "Reablement" type services which are intentionally short lived. A flag for reablement was not available for the data linked for the PhD but will be collected as part of future SCS collections. Coupled with the likely underestimate of coverage discussed above, this finding suggests using the SCS as an indicator of receipt of social care is likely to capture a large majority of individuals receiving long-term care.

Whilst this is welcoming, further issues remain with use of the SCS that limit the types of analyses that can be conducted. The lack of consistent recording of a CHI number in SCS collection meant probabilistic matching methods based on name, date-of-birth, gender, and postcode were required in order to create indexes that could then link the SCS to health records (more fully explained in section \ref{sec:linkage}). Whilst this matching process produced good overall results (91% match rate nationally) and rates were consistent across age, gender, and deprivation groups, there was large variation in match rates at the local authority level (76.7% - 98.5% for 31 of 32 local authorities). In effect, these variations introduce missing data not at random and make comparison in rates of care across local authorities problematic. Analysis in chapter \ref{ch:res2} attempted to overcome this problem by creating two subsets of data including local authorities with above average match rates. Whilst this allows some appraisal of variations in receipt of care at the local authority level, gaining a national picture remains elusive.  

Although these issues are important, and analyses must take account of the limitations, the SCS remains an important resource in international terms. Social care data for research is recognised to be of poorer quality than health related data and often very difficult to link health records in many countries [@RN406]. Where linkages have been able to be made, inclusion of measures of home-based social care are less frequent [@RN610]. This means that, regardless of the limitations described above, the linked health and social care dataset created for analysis in this PhD is an important resource for research as it addresses both of these issues. 

One final (incidental) finding that can be inferred from the analysis of social care data in the Renfrewshire area, reported in chapter \ref{ch:renfrew}, adds to the debate surrounding eligibility and allocation of social care. As argued by Sharkey (2006, p.10) (quoted at the beginning of section \ref{subsubsec:eligibility-uk}), eligibility criteria can be seen as a form of rationing where "...``need" is equated with ``resources available"." Figure \ref{fig:ren-hc-counts} shows that, whilst year-to-year variations are discernable, the weekly variation in the number of individuals receiving home care is remarkably stable. The deduction that a finite number of home care spaces are available at any given time, and that termination of one individual's care must occur before another's can start, seems credible. Whilst this may have been intuitively known previously, figure \ref{fig:ren-hc-counts} provides some empirical evidence to the debate. 

\subsection{Linked Administrative Data Research}\label{sec:disc-admin-data}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Discuss process of obtaining and analysing linked data. Potentially useful for sg and others
\item Timeframe!! Probabaly not a good idea to try this for a PhD given timelines - although has directly led to post-doc research
\item Safe Haven. SDC and software upgrades
\item Suprevisors need to get used to appraising work *in* safe haven. 600 + outputs SDC. Also means format of how to appraise needs agreed. html??
\item Good things???
\item Point to move to re-use data rather than obtain-and-destroy approach
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparisons to Previous Research}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Bardsley and SR of H \& SC studies (inc care home and jenni's stuff)
\item Condelius...
\item Kent economic paper
\item MM stuff
\item medicine counts as MM - Brilleman and Salisbury
\item Narrowing of gap in medicines as age increases mirrors Barnett figure 2
\item Prescription counts similar to Guthrie and McCowan
\end{itemize}

\section{Strengths and Limitations}

\subsection{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Large, population sized linkage
\item Marginal effects
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Census week for home care. Compare 2013/14 and later years in table 5.1. ?6o per cent of all social care. Plus loss to linkage - missing half of all individuals?
\item 91\% overall match rate = 9\% misclassification
\item Linkage of SCS not consistent - difficult to make broad comparisons. Attempted to offset by subsetting. Home care stable though falling in SCS - why?
\item Not really assessed Access to social care (mention time constraint?)
\item No measure for living alone
\item No measure for frailty - likely explanation for distro sc in higher age groups.
\item MM measure not validated - limited due to lack of access to PC data, Also means cannot address important MM questions as laid by AMS e.g. "Which clusters result in the greatest healthcare utilisation and greatest cost?"
\end{itemize}

A final, methadological, finding is that using grouped repeat medicines count as a proxy measure for multimorbidity produced consistent results across both social care and unplanned admission models. Indeed non-reported models with any unscheduled care and A & E attendance as dependent variable showed similar results. Formal validation of the predictive properties of the measure was not conducted

\section{Recommended Future Actions and Research}

\subsection{Future research}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Measure \emph{Longitudinal} changes in social care and impact on admission/usc
\item Break down SC data - home care/telecare influence on outcomes
\item consider futher linkage - look for better measure of living arrangements (alone - census?)
\item include USC/admission as independent variable in SC outcome given SC influence on SC
\item Utilise USC data better - include A \& E, NHS24 etc etc
\item Check post-doc list
\item Mortality
\item Interaction between Primary care and social care.
\item Further investigate medicines as measure of MM - try chapter counts [@RN228] or continuous rather than categorical OR USE DISEASE DATA FROM USC
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A good title}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Broaden timeframe of SCS collection
\item Support LAs to provide either CHI or easily provide all ID data for linkage
\item Better categorisation of social care users - Reablement and Mainstream likely very different types of users and 
\item Better access to Primary Care data for MM research
\end{itemize}
