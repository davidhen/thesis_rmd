\textbf{Background:} Multimorbidity, the presence of two or more long-term health conditions, is increasing in prevalence worldwide. This is due to increasing life expectancy and a greater proportion of the population living to older ages although 30% of those aged 45-65 are also affected. Multimorbidity is associated with a number of negative outcomes including increased mortality, lower quality-of-life, and lower functional status. Unsurprisingly, it is also associated with greater use of health services. Little is known, however, about whether people with multimorbidity also receive more social care. The aim of the research was to assess the relationship between multimorbidity and social care, and the association of multimorbidity and social care on unplanned admission to hospital.

\textbf{Methods:} A retrospective population-based observational study using linked administrative health and social care records was conducted. All individuals over the age of 65 with a valid Community Health Index (CHI) number in Scotland during the financial years 2011/12 to 2015/16 were included. A proxy measurement of multimorbidity derived from prescribing data was used. Logistic regression models reporting Average Partial Effects (APEs) were employed to investigate associations between outcome and explanatory variables. Separately, in order to assess the validity of the Social Care Survey (SCS), all social care data from one local authority was obtained and analysed to assess the proportion of home care users likely to be captured by the SCS. 

\textbf{Results:} Over 1.1 million people were included in the cohort. Multimorbidity is associated with receipt of social care. After adjustment for other variables, a 15% increased probability of receiving social care was observed for those in the highest multimorbidity group (receiving 9+ repeat medicines) compared to the lowest group (receiving 0-2 repeat medicines). Both multimorbidity and receipt of social care are associated with unplanned hospital admission after adjustment (9% increased probability of unplanned admission in the highest multimorbidity group, 7% increased probability for those that received social care). The SCS captures 60% of home care users representing up to 75% of all home care delivered in addition to all individuals receiving community alarm and telecare services.

\textbf{Conclusion:} This is one of the first studies to link health and social care data at a population level. It empirically shows an association between multimorbidity and social care. These findings address a gap in knowledge in current literature and indicate wider societal implications due to the increased prevalence of multimorbidity than has previously been described. No obvious evidence of an "inverse social care law" was found. Rather than having a protective effect on unplanned admission to hospital, receipt of social care is positively associated with this outcome. This has implications for policymakers interested in health and social care integration and the expected benefits of such reorganisation.
