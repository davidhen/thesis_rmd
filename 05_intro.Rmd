\section{Context}\label{sec:intro-context}

Worldwide demographic changes where increases in life expectancy have been driven by better health programmes and treatments has resulted in a growing proportion of the population being over the age of 60 [@RN570; @RN537]. Accompanying this growth is an increase in the prevalence of health conditions most likely to occur in middle-aged and older adults and also the presence of two or more chronic health conditions in one individual - the broadest definition of multimorbidity [@RN570; @RN537; @RN576; @RN93; @RN226]. These changes are seen across the world in both high-income and low-to-middle-income countries where non-communicable diseases have replaced communicable diseases as the major burden of healthcare and contributing to two-thirds of all deaths [@RN570; @RN537; @RN288; @RN160]. The increasing prevalence of multimorbidity has profound impacts for policymakers and research. 

Policymakers in developed countries have to identify ways of financing care where demand is increasing (due to older populations and increased multimorbidity), but supply is decreasing (due to the impacts of budgetary restraint following the financial crash of 2008)[]. Simultaneously,

Need to add [@RN155]


Providers - Shift to PC, specialist v generalist

Levels of multimorbidity in the Scottish population follow a stark socioeconomic profile with those of lower socioeconomic position having higher levels of multiple conditions and more complex care needs which develop 10-15 years earlier than their more affluent peers [@RN33; @RN21]. This inequality in outcome is compounded by the fact that primary care provision in areas of higher socioeconomic disadvantage, ergo areas of higher need, receive the same or less funding as other more affluent areas. This inequity in provision of service demonstrates existence of the inverse care law in primary care services [@RN120; @RN39; @RN148] and has already been discussed in section \ref{subsubsec:theory-resources}.

Regardless of how it is defined, there is widespread recognition that multimorbidity is a growing problem worldwide with some evidence suggesting there are disproportionate effects for women and those of lower socioeconomic position [@RN570; @RN15; @RN33]. Although the association between multimorbidity and increasing age is well documented [@RN570; @RN155], a large proportion of younger, working age adults also have multiple chronic conditions [@RN403; @RN615]. In one landmark study, the absoloute number of people with multimorbidity under the age of 65 was higher than for those over 65 [@RN33]. 

Health services, health research, and health guidelines are predominantly designed around single diseases [@RN570; @RN155; @RN403]. Clinical guidelines are often based on the results of Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) which often exclude those of older age, and those with multimorbidity. The absence of these groups in trials of treatments means  [@RN616; @RN617].  evidence leaving those with multimorbidity being treated by multiple health practitioners with the risk of  receiving multiple treatments from multiple specialities at risk of conflicting treatments

Individuals - treatment burden. Outcomes

One notable omission in literature \emph{and} guidelines is effect on social care. Most position papers concentrate on \emph{health} services. What about SC?? NICE guideline

*edit this*

Internationally, provision of social care has become one of the most important issues for policy makers in recent years [@RN406; @RN250] \textit{Context, Trump, Korea, ISIS etc). Some of the key principles of health and social care integration legislation in Scotland are aimed at improving care for those with multiple long-term health conditions - also known as multimorbidity [@RN266; @RN251]. In Scotland, approximately two-thirds of individuals receiving social care services are over the age of 65 [@RN128] whilst approximately two-thirds of all those over the age of 65 have multimorbidity [@RN33]. 

It would seem intuitive that a large proportion of those receiving social care have multimorbidity. However, no single data source exists that allows this comparison to be made. Nevertheless, guidelines exist for healthcare professionals to assist in assessing the social care needs of older people with multiple long term conditions [@RN150]. Multimorbidity is associated with a number of negative outcomes including increased health care usage [@RN226]. Whether multimorbidity increases use of social care services is unknown but this could have an important role in informing policy decisions regarding social care provision.

\section{Aims}\label{sec:intro-aims}

Need to add in exploratory in nature. 

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Identify best resource of sc data and assess suitability for research
\item Create a linked dataset that can be used to answer questions relevant to the provision of health and social care services 
\item Describe the relationship between MM and SC
\item Describe the relationship between SC use and unplanned hospital admission
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}\label{sec:intro-objs}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Identify SC data sources by liaison with relevant stakeholders
\item Identify best HC data sources suitable to achieve aims
\item Assess to what extent measures of multimorbidity and health \& social care service use can be operationalised using existing health and social care administrative data.
\item Obtain governance approval for data linkage
\item Clean and analyse linked data in accordance with aims and RQs
\item Make recommendations to policy makers on administrative data collections.
\end{itemize}

\section{Research questions}\label{sec:intro-rq}

These broad issues inform the background of this thesis. Funding for the PhD was provided by the Scottish Government with the specific intention of exploring the possibilities of linking routinely held health and social care data to address these issues. Based on the aims and objectives described in chapter \ref{ch:intro} and the literature reviewed in this chapter the following research questions have been formulated:- 

In people over the age of 65 in Scotland:

1. 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item What are the socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic patterns in the use of social care? \item Is there an association between multimorbidity status and the amount and type of social care use over time? Does this vary by the patterns described in 1(a)?  
\end{enumerate}
2. 
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Is there an association in the use of social care services, multimorbidity status and unscheduled health care use?
\item Do multimorbidity status and social care use predict mortality?
\end{enumerate}
 

\section{Scientific contribution}\label{sec:intro-contrib}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item First description of the relationship between SC and MM (in UK)
\item First \emph{national} level study looking at SC and unplanned hosp admission
\end{itemize}


\section{Thesis structure}\label{sec:lit-review-structure}


**Below old stuff**

Many countries, including the United Kingdom (UK), have recently seen policies implemented that aim to integrate the provision of health and social care services [@RN234; @RN362; @RN262]. In addition to reducing variations in the provision of care across geographic areas, these policies hope to save public money by reducing unplanned admissions and delayed discharges from hospital whilst also improving the quality of services for individuals [@RN232; @RN266; @RN406].

The World Health Organisation [-@RN320] cites relative inequalities in improvements of health and life expectancy, within and between countries, as justification for recommended structural change to healthcare [@RN320]. The paradigm shift in the method of service delivery is suggested in response to increasing long-term, chronic conditions forming the major burden of care worldwide. Integrating health and social care services and increasing primary care spend are cited as two potential ways of facilitating this shift in focus [@RN320].

Policies introduced that facilitate integration of services have been implemented despite little evidence to suggest they will have the desired effect [@RN367; @RN369; @RN234; @RN233; @RN321; @RN362; @RN366; @RN260]. The continued drive to integrate services does, however, implicitly acknowledge that health and social care services are linked. How these services interact at the individual level and whether differing levels of provision in each service affects the other is not well understood [@RN361; @RN406].

Until recently many local authorities had attempted to protect front-line services, such as social care, from austerity cuts [@RN117]. However, given continued year-on-year reductions and a further 7.2% cut to local authority spending in 2016/2017 [@RN251], the ability to protect social care from reductions in spend becomes less likely. Decreased local government budgets across the UK and Scotland since 2010 have affected those living in the poorest areas hardest [@RN117; @RN484]. If social care budgets decrease further, the question of whether the most deprived areas will feel these cuts most is of grave importance.
