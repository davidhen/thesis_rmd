\chapter{Literature Review}\label{ch:lit-review}
\thispagestyle{empty}


This chapter identifies and summarises academic and policy literature relevant to the thesis. Literature regarding a) access to social care, b) health and social care interaction and c) multimorbidity is presented. As the main research is conducted with Scottish data, there is appropriate focus in the structures and policies regarding health and social care in this country. However, this is placed in the wider context of the UK and developed world. 

The chapter is organised in three parts following the main themes listed above. Section \ref{sec:access-sc} focuses on social care from a number of perspectives: varying definitions of the term, differing international models of care delivery, social theory of eligibility and resource allocation, and finally the impact on health inequalities. 

Section \ref{sec:hsc-interaction} outlines the policy framework regarding health and social care services, how these services are funded and delivered, and why they are linked. It then describes the legislation that made health and social care integration law in Scotland before reviewing empirical evidence of the nature of the interaction between health and social care services.

Section \ref{sec:mm} describes why multimorbidity is important in the context of health and social care integration and then provides an overview of academic literature and policy documents regarding multimorbidity and its definitions, measurement, and epidemiology.

\textbf{Add in paragraph or two outlining literature search strategy}

\section{Multimorbidity}\label{sec:mm}

This section reviews relevant literature regarding multimorbdity. Firstly, an overview of the main themes found in the literature is provided before more in depth reviews of three main themes arising from this: concepts and definitions of multimorbidity, measures of multimorbidity, and finally multimorbidity in the context of health inequalities.

\subsection{Context}\label{subsec:litrv-mm-context}

At first sight, the definition of multimorbidity as the presence of two or more health conditions in one individual appears clear and concise. In fact, there are many competing concepts and definitions of multimorbidity in research literature resulting in confusing messages regarding epidemiology, measurement, and treatment [@RN570; @RN89; @RN95; @RN77; @RN155]. One systematic review found the prevalance of multimorbidty in the general population to vary between 13.1% - 71.8% in studies where different definitions had been employed [@RN56]. Another, concentrating on primary care populations, reported variation of prevalence between 12.9% and 95.1% [@RN15].

Despite this, it is generally accepted that multimorbidity is the norm for individuals with at least one chronic condition [@RN155] in both high-income and low-to-middle-income countries[@RN619]. It disproportionately affects those of lowest socioeconomic position [@RN570; @RN155] who can develop multimorbidity up to 10 to 15 years earlier than their most affluent counterparts and are more likely to have a mix of physical and mental health conditions [@RN33]. Females are also disproportionately affected although evidence suggets this association can vary across countries [@RN570]. 

There is also a concensus that multimorbidity is associated with a number of negative outcomes including: higher mortality [@RN81; @RN155], reduced quality-of-life [@RN241; @RN242; @RN155], reduced functional status [@RN40; @RN155], and increased psychological distress [@RN243]. All of these are likely contributors to the association of multimorbidity with increased use of healthcare services [@RN81; @RN22; @RN155].

This raises a particular challenge to those responsible for delivering healthcare which has been traditionally structured around treating single diseases. This is partly due to the fact that many clinical guidelines are based on the results of Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs) investigating the efficacy of a single treatment on a single disease [@RN570; @RN403; @RN599; @RN508; @RN505]. The fact that those with multimorbidity are routinely excluded from such trials means the effectiveness of treatments (and presence of adverse events) in "the real world" are often unquantified [@RN570; @RN403; @RN599; @RN508; @RN505]. The increased use of services also has financial implications for societies grappling with constraints imposed by austerity measures [@RN618].

One potential solution to improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery is to focus resorces in community and primary care services rather than expensive secondary care [@RN320]. Here, care can be focussed in a more holistic sense by identifying goals and targets in partnership with the individual themselves [@RN508; @RN360; @RN275]. Services provided by healthcare professionals with generalist rather than specialist skills (such as multi-disciplinary teams in primary care), are best placed to deliver this type of care and can foster preventative, cost-effective measures for those with, or at risk of developing, multimorbidity [@RN599; @RN570; @RN403; @RN508; @RN155; @RN275; @RN502]. 

This is particularly true where primary care services are provided on a universal basis which widens the scope of access to service [@RN599; @RN155; @RN275]. That said, universal coverage in itself does not guarantee equitable access to care. First coined by Julian Tudor-Hart [-@RN120], the Inverse Care Law describing reduced availability of good medical care in areas of highest need has been shown to be alive and well in countries with universal primary care coverage [@RN27; @RN148; @RN121; @RN583; @RN275]. 

Given these many challenges, a recent Academy of Medical Sciences report [-@RN570] highlights a number of areas where research into multimorbidity should be directed including: indentifying trends and patterns of multimorbidity (including clusters of conditions), the determinents of condition clusters, prevention strategies, risk-assessment strategies, and healthcare (re)organisation. The NICE guidline on multimorbidity assessment and management [-@RN226] suggests research should focus on: organisation of (primary) care, community assessment, medicines management, and the prediciton of life expectancy. Absent from both these guidelines, save passing references, are consideration of the effect of multimorbidity on \emph{social} care services.

Inclusion of social care as a factor associated with multimorbidity is justified by an earlier NICE guideline entitled, "Older people with social care needs and multiple long-term conditions" [-@RN150]. As the title suggests, the guideline frames social care needs as an additional dimension to the assessment required for people with multimorbidity. There are no reccomendations, or indeed acknowledgement, of the effect multimorbidity may have as a driver of need for social care. Social support, along with other patient-relevant outcome measures (PROMs) (such as functional disability), are often included as independent variables indicating a modifying effect on multimorbidity rather than outcomes where multimorbidity may be a contributing factor [@RN571]. Recognition of this fact has led to calls for the social context of indiviudals with multimorbidity to be more fully investigated [@RN544; @RN620]. 

Whilst this gap in knowledge is the justification for the research carried out in the thesis, and further explored later in this chapter, the remainder of this section will expand on the themes outlined above with reference to multimorbidity. Those themes with particular relevance to the thesis are covered. Firstly, an overview of literature regarding the complexity of the concept and defintion of multimorbidity is presented. This is followed by a review of the many methods that have been employed to measure multimorbidity. Finally, an overview of relevant literature regarding health inequalities in the context of multimorbidity is also presented with a specific focus on UK based literature.     

\subsection{Concepts and definitions}\label{subsec:mm-defs}

Despite the increasing importance of multimorbidity on health care systems, there has been some debate internationally in finding an agreed definition of the term or concept [@RN89; @RN95; @RN570]. This section outlines some of the literature giving a historical view of 

One source of confusion that is commonly found in research relating to two or more health conditions is in the numerous ways in which it is labelled including: polymorbidity, polypathology, pluripathology, multipathology, and multicondition [@RN89].  The two most frquently used terms, multimorbidity and comorbidity,  are often (incorrectly) used interchangeably despite a distinction being articulated over 20 years ago [@RN19; @RN571]. Comorbidity was originally described by Fenstein [@RN338,467] who stated, "In a patient with a particular index disease, the term co-morbidity refers to any additional co-existing ailment." Van Den Akker et al. [-@RN19,65] separated this term from multimorbidity which they described as , "...any co-occurrence of medical conditions within a person." In this sense, multimorbidity does not rely on the presence of a primary, or index, disease but refers to the overall state of multiple illnesses. The recent addition of a distinct MeSH heading for multimorbidity that can be used to search medical literature databases signals the impotance of the difference in these terms (previously, only comorbidity was available as a MeSH heading) [@RN573]. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/chapter-lit-review/valderas.pdf}
    \caption{Conceptual framework of co/multimorbidity. Valderas et al. (2009)}
    \label{fig:valderas}
\end{figure}

An aide to further clarify this distinction is a broader conceptual framework provided by Valderas et al. [-@RN64] (figure \ref{fig:valderas}) who characterise the construct of the multiple terms found in the literature into four main groups; (a) comorbidity – additional diseases in the context of an index disease, (b) multimorbidity – more than one disease within an individual (without reference to an index disease), (c) morbidity burden – total impact of physiological dysfunction linked to disease severity and (d) patient complexity – the effect of non-health characteristics (e.g. deprivation, culture, environment) on the whole.

Valderas et al. [-@RN64] discuss these four constructs further in relation to three main research areas; clinical care, epidemiology \& public health, and health service planning. It is suggested that comorbidity may be a more valid definition for use in specialist clinical care, whereas multimorbidity and morbidity burden would be more appropriate in primary care research. In epidemiological and public health research, the definitions of either comorbidity or multimorbidity would be of use depending on the origin of the diseases being studied and the particular research questions being investigated. Morbidity burden and patient complexity are the most appropriate definitions for research exploring healthcare use and costs [@RN64]. 

Relying on the term for multimorbidity in figure \ref{fig:valderas} does not, however, completely solve the problem of definition. Intuitively, the term signifies more than one condition, but which conditions should be included? The findings of three systematic reviews have highlighted the myriad ways researchers have approached this problem [@RN16; @RN34; @RN29]. Each review aimed to collate evidence of measurement tools in comorbidity or multimorbidity but from different perspectives: De Groot et al [-@RN16] searched for comorbidity indices to inform research into Multiple Sclerosis, Diederichs et al [-@RN34] specifically searched for multimorbidity measurement indices, whereas Huntley et al [-@RN29] searched for measures of multimorbidity used only in primary care research. The systematic reviews found 13, 39 and 17 exclusive ways of measuring multimorbidity or comorbidity respectively. Adding even further complexity, the number of medical conditions included in these measurements varied from 4 to 102 [@RN34]. 

More recently, a systematic review focused on which diseases, risk factors and symptoms are included in varying definitions of multimorbidity [@RN254]. Whilst the majority of included studies in the review indicated multimorbidity as the presence of two or more conditions, Willadsen et al [-@RN254] found the total number of diseases, risk factors, and symptoms used varied from 4 to 147. Of the 167 included articles in the review, 115 different ways of defining multimorbidity were identified [@RN254]. Another review found the number of conditions used in measures of multimorbidity varied from from 5 to 335 [@RN15].

Acknowledging the perverse impact this has on advancing knowledge through research, attempts have been made to find a unifying definition of multimorbidity that can be employed to facilitate synthesis of research findings. These included:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]

\item \begin{quotation} ``being affected by two or more chronic health conditions in the same individual'' \hfill (WHO, 2016) \end{quotation} 

\item \begin{quotation} ``...any combination of chronic disease with at least one other disease (acute or chronic) biopsychosocial factor (associated or not) or somatic risk factor.'' \hfill (EGPRN, 2013) \end{quotation} 

\item \begin{quotation} ``more than 1 long-term condition with any of the following:- \begin{itemize}[noitemsep] \item Difficulty managing treatments or day-to-day activities. \item Care from multiple services and requiring care from a new service \item Both long-term physical and mental health conditions \item Frailty \item Frequent use of unplanned or emergency care \item Prescription of multiple, regular medicines'' \end{itemize} \hfill(NICE, 2016) \end{quotation} 
\end{enumerate}

In the NICE guideline [-@RN226] there is an agreement with other commentators [@RN21] that basing the definition of multimorbidity on two or more health conditions \textit{only} does not fully capture a clinically meaningful picture of the concept. The guideline highlights the fact that many people defined as multimorbid in this way may not be ill and have excellent quality of life requiring little or no health care input [@RN226]. Whilst definitions two and three above attempt to address this problem, it could be argued that they are, respectively, ambiguous and over-complex.  

The most recent attempt to standardise a definition of multimorbidity has been provided with the AMS which in less ambiguous than that provided by the EGPRN and less complex than that posited by NICE.

\begin{quotation} ``The co-existence of two or more chronic conditions, each one of which is either \begin{itemize}[noitemsep] \item A physical non-communicable disease of long duration, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer \item A mental health condition of long duration, such as mood disorder or dementia \item An infectious disease of long duration, such as HIV or hepatitis C'' \end{itemize} \hfill (AMS, 2018) \end{quotation}

Although multimorbidity may seem to be an intuitive thing to understand, defining a useful concept of the term has proved to be much more difficult [@RN155]. The definition articulated by the AMS has the benefit of being relatively concise and clear and will be used to describe multimorbidity hereon in the thesis.  

\subsection{Measurement tools}\label{subsec:mm-measures}

Adding further complexity to conducting multimorbidity research is the many ways in which it can be measured. Until recently, there were two main ways: simple disease counts or using an index which applies weights to either prescribed medications or medical conditions and other factors in an attempt to capture the effect of disease severity on multimorbidity (crudely consistent with the term morbidity burden (figure \ref{fig:valderas})) [@RN16; @RN34; @RN29]. Advanced computing power has added a third method of multimorbidity measurement through the identification of non-random clusters of medical conditions via statistical algorithms [@RN98]. These clusters can be used to help understand the aeitology of multimorbidity, assess the impact of clusters on health outcomes, and which determinants of multimorbidity are associated with clusters [@RN98; @RN570].

In primary care research, the most frequently used measurement is simple disease counts [@RN29]. This may be because of the ease with which it can be administered compared to more complex indices e.g. the Charlson index [@RN339] the Chronic Disease Score (CDC) [@RN340], or the Adjusted Clinical Group (ACG) system [@RN341] and their variations. It could be expected that indices may capture the complexity of multimorbidity more effectively, however Huntley et al [-@RN29] cite evidence that suggests simple counts of diseases or medications are almost as effective at predicting mortality or health care use in the primary care setting. Disease counts were also found by Huntley et al [-@RN29] to have good evidence to suggest they provide a robust measure of multimorbidity in relation to quality of life, as does the Charlson index [@RN339]. 

In many areas, access to data listing disease types for individuals can be problematic. Brilleman & Salisbury [-@RN247] found a count of prescribed medicines was equivialent to a number of more complex indices when predicting primary care use and mortality in an English setting. This confirmed results found in a study of an American cohort [@RN78] where the authors also argued that indices developed in the secondary care setting, such as the Charlson index, should be used with caution in other settings despite adaptions. More recently, Wallace et al [-@RN228] found little difference between simple (count) and complex (index) measures and that medication-based measures were equivalent to diagnosis-based measures in predicting outcomes. The use of medicine counts as a proxy for multimorbidity offers a good alternative to disease-based counts or measures. 

Recent research and academic discussion suggests identification of disease clusters may enable clearer answers to clinically relevant research questions than currently employed measures [@RN96; @RN109; @RN98; @RN99; @RN188; @RN31; @RN64]. In systematic reviews of clustering methods, wide variations in approaches to clustering and characteristics of populations studied have been found[@RN98; @RN578]. Statistical techniques employed in attempts to identify such clusters include: factor analysis, cluster analysis, the observed-to-expected ratio, multiple correspondence analysis [@RN98; @RN301; @RN578], principal component analysis, latent class analysis [@RN109; @RN365], and machine learning techniques [@RN273]. 

Prados-Torres et al [-@RN98] identified three groups of patterns common to all included studies in their review despite marked heterogeneity namely; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, mental health conditions, and musculoskeletal disorders. No studies have yet demonstrated associations between clusters and health or health realted outcomes, but identification of clusters remains a research priority in the immediate future [@RN570]. 

\subsection{Multimorbidity and health inequalities}

\begin{quotation} ``The term ``health inequality'' is usually employed to refer to the systematic differences in health which exists between different population groups (e.g. different social classes or ethnic groups)'' \hfill (Smith \emph{et al.}, 2016, p.1) \end{quotation}

There is no biological reason for poorer people to have worse health or to die earlier than the richest [@RN380]. Yet over the last five decades. despite overall trends, the most disadvantaged in society have seen slower improvements in health and life expectacy than the most affluent resulting in a widening gap in health outcomes.  [@RN622; @RN325; @RN315]. A well documented gradient running from the most affluent to the most deprived has been observed [@RN303; @RN312]. There are a number of social determinants of health that contribute to this situation including: access to healthcare, deprivation, quality of housing, and unemployment [@RN622; @RN62; @RN307]. 

Health inequalities have been observed between and within countries all over the world regardless of relative prosperity [@RN622]. The Black report [-@RN326], published by the UK Government almost 40 years ago, brought the subject of health inequality to international attention [@RN327]. It both described and attempted to explain the phenomenon present in the UK. Successive governments commissioned subsequent reports that have described similar findings and new insights [@RN328; @RN329; @RN312]. However, there has been little progress in impementing reccommendations fron these reports and thus little progress in reducing disparities in health [@RN330; @RN331; @RN332; @RN378].

In the UK, poverty remains the largest predictor of relative ill health and has associations with increased morbidity, multimorbidity, and decreased life expectancy [@RN37]. People living in deprived areas are more likely to engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours, experience multimorbidity at a younger age, and live in overcrowded or unsuitable housing [@RN37; @RN311]. 

A recent analysis released by the Office for National Statistics suggests the gap in male life expectancy between 2015-2017 across local authorities in England was 8.5 years, in Northern Ireland 4 years, and in Wales 4.1 years [@RN375]. At 7.2 years the largest gap in male life expectancy in the UK was found in Scotland. Those born in East Dunbartonshire were expected to live to 80.1 years, whereas those in Glasgow City were expected to live 73.3 years [@RN375]. 

There has been some argument that research on health inequalities has placed an over-emphasis on deprivation at the expense of understanding the role of access to health services, particularly in the UK where there is universal health coverage [@RN621]. Research in countries where markets play a greater role in health care delivery, such as the USA, are more likely to produce literature focussing on service access [@RN621].  This is likely due to the fact that those of lower socioeconomic position are less able to pay market-price for health care - thus reducing access - which underpins the theory of the "inverse care law" which states that, \begin{quotation} ``The availiabilty of good medical care tends to vary inversely for the need for it, in the population served'' \hfill{Tudor-Hart, 1971}\end{quotation} This argument, however, does not take into account statistics and research showing that universal health care in itself does not guard against the inverse care law.  

People living in more deprived areas have lower life expectancy and higher morbidity figures and therefore greater health needs [@RN37]. However, the poorest neighbourhoods in England have been reported to have 62.5 General Practitioners (GP) per 100,000 population whereas the most affluent neighbourhoods have 76.2 per 100,000 [@RN317] which suggests health provision does not match need. Recent planned changes in policy to distribute primary care funding based on population age are likely to exacerbate this situation [@RN39]. Indeed, increases in workload with deteriorating proportions of budgets has lead the King’s Fund to describe the situation in primary care in England and Wales as, “in crisis” [@RN318, pp.3]. In Scotland, the  even distribution of GP workforce among the population means GP practices in the most deprived areas need to provide more consultations, for people with greater needs, at the same funding level as practices with fewer resource demands [@RN148; @RN27]. Poorer access to primary health care is associated with greater demand for unnecessary admission to hospital [@RN49; @RN268] which is responsible for high proportions of healthcare expenditure. The inverse care law is alive and well in the UK, despite universal coverage. 

There are many theories as to why inequalities in health exist across socioeconomic position [@RN327; @RN333] with intensive research dating back to the Black report published by the UK government [@RN326].  Some of these, such as statistical artefact and biological reasons, were rejected as being implausible by the Black report [@RN277]. To a large extent, epidemiological evidence and theoretical argument has agreed with that view [@RN327; @RN83; @RN82; @RN333].

There have been many critiques of the other theories proposed in the last 35 years which focus on differing numbers of proposals [@RN327; @RN333; @RN377; @RN378; @RN83]. Whilst arguments over which theory is most plausible to explain the cause of health inequality, most researchers agree on ways to remedy disparities in health outcome. These are the redistribution of income, wealth, and political power [@RN378; @RN391; @RN327; @RN333]. Although health services have an important role to play, it is the "upstream" policies of redistribution that will make the biggest impacts in improving health outcomes across society [@RN378; @RN391; @RN327; @RN325]. Whilst this has been known for some time, government policies in the UK to date have not addressed these issues and have thus failed to make meaningful improvements in health inequalities [@RN330; @RN331; @RN377].




\subsection{Summary}\label{subsec:mm-summary}

Multimorbidity is most commonly defined as the presence (or co-occurrence) of two or more long-term conditions in an individual. Debate continues as to the type and number of long-term conditions that should be included to provide a meaningful concept for individuals, clinicians and healthcare organisations. The lack of a standard definition is mirrored in the myriad ways of measuring multimorbidity with various counts, indices, and clusters. Despite this, evidence suggests multimorbidity is increasing in prevalence and has a strong socioeconomic pattern. As a result, policy needs to be tailored to account for the complex needs of the increasing numbers of people with multimorbidity.

\textbf{Need to pull multimorbidity together with social care. MM high health care costs and also has an impact on socal care use - see feedback notes. ALSO use NICE guideline on social care for people with MM}

\section{Social Care}\label{sec:access-sc}

\textbf{Add intro paragraph}

To understand the impact of MM on SC, first need to understand SC itself etc.etc.

\textbf{Consider restructuring section a)International models, b) resource allocation, c) eligibility. OR theory altogether and then Scotland only at end}

\subsection{Definitions}\label{subsec:access-sc-defs}

There is no internationally (or nationally) accepted definition of social care. Indeed, the difference between what is social care and what is health care has no clear line of demarcation resulting in local variation in provision of services [@RN371]. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Union (EU) jointly published a report on Long Term Care (LTC) for older people discussing much of what may be described in the UK as social care. In the report, LTC is defined as,

\begin{quotation}
"... a range of services required by persons with a reduced degree of functional capacity, physical or cognitive, and who are consequently dependent for an extended period of time on help with basic activities of daily living (ADL). This "personal care" component is frequently provided in combination with help with basic medical services such as "nursing care" (wound dressing, pain management, medication, health monitoring), as well as prevention, rehabilitation or palliative care. Long-term care services can also be combined with lower level care related to “domestic help” or help with instrumental activities of daily living (IADL)." 
\end{quotation} [@RN406, pp38]

A recent NICE guideline [-@RN150] addressing social care needs for older people with multiple chronic conditions used a definition provided in the UK Health and Social Care Act [-@RN149]:-
\begin{quotation}
	““Adult social care”—
	(a) includes all forms of personal care and other practical assistance provided for individuals who, by reason of age, illness, disability, pregnancy, childbirth, dependence on alcohol or drugs, or any other similar circumstances, are in need of such care or other assistance, but 
	(b) does not include anything provided by an establishment or agency for which Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Education, Children’s Services and Skills is the registration authority under section 5 of the Care Standards Act 2000.”
	(The Health and Social Care Act  2012 c7, Part 3, Chapter 1, Section 65, Subsection 4)
\end{quotation}  
The NICE guideline [-@RN150] advises that social care planning for people with multimorbidity should include holistic assessment of biopsychosocial factors including sexual, spiritual, cultural, and communication needs. It should also consider access to leisure and social activities whilst incorporating issues regarding mobility and transport. Specifically, the guideline cites; self-care, taking medicines, learning, volunteering, maintaining a home, financial management, employment, socialising with friends and hobbies as activities that all patients should be able to take part in should they wish to and social care assessment should assess the ability of the individual to achieve this.

A more succinct definition of social care is used in a report to the Minister for Care Services at the UK Department of Health, :- 
\begin{quotation}
	"The group of services that provide personal care and support to people in social situations – such as family; the community; a communal setting; to help them achieve independence and to promote their positive contribution as citizens." Platt 
\end{quotation} [-@RN154, pp. 4]

Huxley et al. [-@RN153] are critical of this service-based definition and argue that social care is intended to improve general well-being for those that are in need. As quality of life is an important factor of well-being, Huxley et al. [-@RN153] argue that wider issues regarding environment and the quality of public and private services also play an important role in social care. Indeed, Daly and Lewis [-@RN146, pp.287] argue that social care is “…an activity and set of relations lying at the intersection of state, market, family (and voluntary sector) relations.”

This view is reflected in an aspirational constitution for social care published by an independent, cross-party think-tank [@RN136]. The authors argue that all citizens should have an equal ability to live and control a full and active life. Where this is not possible the state should have a duty to provide the necessary help, in whatever form that is required, to individuals who require it.

A more clearly defined concept is that of \textit{personal care} which has been provided for free in Scotland since 2002. The legislation introduced by the then Scottish Executive necessitated a clear definition and constitutes six dimensions [@RN373, pp.256]. 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item personal hygiene: washing etc.  
\item personal assistance: help with dressings, prostheses etc.  
\item continence management: toileting, catheter management etc.  
\item food and diet: help with eating, food preparation etc.  
\item problems of immobility:  
\item simple treatments: help with medicines, creams, oxygen therapy etc. 
\end{itemize}

**Need a definition of reablement here also** Try http://www.careinfoscotland.scot/topics/care-at-home/

**Maybe an overall description of SCS social care - home care, telecare, equip etc. see data specification documents and (potentially) IJPDS paper**

Personal care is, however, only one aspect of social care provision and clear definitions of other services provided to individuals are lacking. Nevertheless, the definitions of social (or long-term) care above all highlight services that are required to aid with an individual's functional or cognitive needs.

A final definition provided by Colombo et al[-@RN414] will be used for the purposes of this thesis:- 

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label={\alph*)}]
\item a group of services such as; skilled nursing care, social work, personal care, medical equipment \& technologies, and therapies. Delivered by,   
\item a range of  professionals such as; nurses, low-skilled carers, or allied health professionals. In,  
\item various locations such as; at home, in an institution, or via community care.
\end{enumerate}

  
This definition clearly captures the broad range of services that can be associated with social care that are only partially provided in other definitions. It acknowledges that social care can include a number of components including personal, nursing care and help with other domestic activities, and articulates the variety of settings where this can take place. Whilst it is common in Europe to  describe "Long-term care" in relation to these services, this thesis will refer to "social care" as this is the most commonly used term in the UK. Furthermore, unless stated otherwise, reference to social care in this thesis will be with regard to care received by adults over the age of 65. 

\textbf{Add a paragraph with synthesis and critical appraisal of definitions - perhaps before last definition to provide a justification for why it was chosen}

\subsection{International models of social care}\label{subsec:access-sc-models}

There are four ways in which social care can be provided to those in need; informally via family or community, formally via voluntary non-profit organisations, formally via the state, or formally via for-profit organisations [@RN346]. In Europe, increasing demand from users has led to many welfare systems being unable to adequately provide care [@RN344; @RN414]. Changes in demography, the labour market, democracy, and values have all contributed to the increasing pressure on formal care services [@RN406; @RN342; @RN414]. There is wide consensus that lower birth rates and higher proportions of older people mean that a gap has emerged in the number of adult children able to provide informal care to their parents [@RN342; @RN343; @RN344; @RN346; @RN345; @RN414]. Traditionally, informal care was provided by women. As gender equality improves, more women are employed in non-domestic settings which also reduces the pool of informal social care available [@RN342]. Anttonen [-@RN342] also cites changes in societal attitudes from "familism" to "individualism" as having an impact on informal care resources. These combined factors mean that informal care services are no longer as readily available and formal care mechanisms are increasingly required to provide social care. Pressures on these services has seen increased discussion and comparison of models of care across Europe over the last 20 years [@RN347; @RN348; @RN346; @RN349].

In a report for the OECD, Colombo et al [-@RN414] categorised the varying models of social care into three main groups with subdivisions as shown in Table \ref{tab:oecd-soc-care}.

  \caption{Models of social care in OECD countries adapted from Colombo et al (2011)}
  \label{tab:oecd-soc-care}
\end{table}

Universal models of social care are characterised by; a) a single system being in place for delivery of services, b) nursing \textit{and} personal care are provided for all individuals meeting defined eligibility criteria, and c) some form of charge is levied on service-users [@RN414]. Three subdivisions of universal coverage social care models are identified in this classification. 

The tax-based universal models, also known as the Nordic model of care, have strong local-government influence in both the raising of funds and delivery of services [@RN414; @RN348; @RN346; @RN349]. Overall responsibility remains with national government which also contributes funds, often dependent on local population need and structure [@RN414]. Public long-term insurance schemes are mandatory in the countries that employ them, although the age at which citizens begin to contribute varies (e.g. only over 40s contribute in Japan) [@RN414; @RN413; @RN407]. These models have found it increasingly difficult to fund provision and have either increased user-payments or decreased coverage in recent years [@RN345; @RN413; @RN407]. In Belgium, social care is viewed as a health risk and is financed through the health system with a cap on user-contribution. This results in a medical (rather than social) model of care delivery, mostly provided by nurses [@RN414]. 

In contrast to universal models described above where a single system is in place for social care delivery, mixed social care systems employ either; a) universal coverage via different sources/sectors or b) a mixture of universal and means-tested benefits [@RN414]. Whilst acknowledging the wide variation in systems, Colombo et al [-@RN414] identify three subdivisions of mixed system models of social care as shown in table \ref{tab:oecd-soc-care}.

Parallel universal schemes provide social care via two or more sectors (e.g. nursing care via health provider and personal care from a non-healthcare source as seen in Scotland) [@RN414]. Major differences exist between countries in how this is delivered in practice with varying degrees of coverage. Income related universal benefits provide needs-based universal coverage of social care but benefits received vary according to income [@RN414]. France provides a good example of this system where cash benefits are need \textit{and} income based - benefits are paid at six levels of dependency, those with higher incomes are paid proportionally less and top-up care costs themselves [@RN414; @RN420]. The final subdivision of mixed social care models has some universal entitlements provided alongside means-tested services e.g. free provision of nursing care with means-testing for personal care. 

Colombo et al [-@RN414] include Spain and Greece in this final subdivision of mixed social care models but note these countries have formal care systems that are much less developed than elsewhere in the OECD. Sometimes referred to as the Mediterranean model, informal care from family and other sources constitutes the main form of social care in these countries [@RN348; @RN346; @RN349]. As this role is traditionally carried out by women, the Mediterranean model has attracted criticism from a feminist perspective [@RN346].

The final model in Colombo et al's [-@RN414] classification of social care in OECD countries is the means-tested safety net model (Table \ref{tab:oecd-soc-care}). In this model only those below a pre-determined threshold are entitled to state-provided social care. Despite the free provision of health care and some non-means-tested benefits, England is included in this category in the report. Presumably this is due to the fact that state support in a residential home in England is provided only after an individual has depleted both income \textit{and} assets below a threshold [@RN414], a system not seen in other countries \footnote{A cap of approximately £72,000 total contribution was to be introduced in 2016 (Eleftheriades et al., 2013)} [@RN420].

Of the three models of social care described in this section, universal systems can be seen as having a number of advantages over the other two [@RN414; @RN420]. Sharing the burden of social care provision among the entire population, either via general taxation or mandatory insurance schemes, results in a reliable, predictable source of finance enabling states to plan more effectively [@RN414; @RN420; @RN413]. Mixed systems of social care can still result in considerable costs for those that require care, whereas the costs to individuals in the means-tested system can be "catastrophic" [@RN414, pp240]. The means-tested system can also be perceived as unfair for those that need to sell assets (such as a house) to pay for care, particularly when there is variation in eligibility criteria within countries [@RN414; @RN420; @RN421; @RN407; @RN413]. A particular advantage of a universal social care system is that it, 
\begin{quotation} 
"...generally reduces utilisation of more expensive health care services and professionals (e.g. hospital care, doctors) for long-term care needs, for example by making "social hospitalisation" of frail people with [social care] needs more difficult." 
\end{quotation} [@RN414, pp.222]

Given the pressures on state budgets and the desire to adequately fund care services, this seems a particularly useful benefit of the universal coverage model of social care. 

Disadvantages of universal systems are that they are generally more expensive to the state than other models of social care and can reduce the amount of informal care provided by relatives for elderly family [@RN414; @RN407]. The comprehensiveness of coverage can be over-burdensome for the state with a number of countries recently having to cut service or increase user-contributions to compensate for increasing demand [@RN345; @RN421; @RN407; @RN413]. 

\textit{Need to mention typologu does not cover quality or quantity of care}.

A recent examination of the effects of the 2008 financial crisis on the way social care is delivered across Europe suggests that the distinctions between social care models is beginning to blur [@RN343]. There is evidence those with more comprehensive coverage are reducing levels of care whilst those with less coverage are increasing provision [@RN414]. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/chapter-lit-review/oecd-comparison.pdf}
    \caption{Older recipients of long-term care services as a share of the over 65 population, 2008}
    \label{fig:oecd-comparison}
\end{figure}

Given the marked variations in how social care is funded and delivered across countries, it may be expected that there are also marked variations in levels of access and utilisation. Colombo et al [-@RN414] produced a chart (shown in figure \ref{fig:oecd-comparison}) derived from OECD data that shows the proportion of over 65s receiving some form of social care across countries for which data is provided. The chart shows that having a universal or mixed system of social care provision (as described above) does not absolutely influence the number of people receiving care. For example, South Korea employs a universal (insurance-based) system and has one of the lowest proportions of older people receiving care, whereas Switzerland has one of the highest whilst employing a mixed system involving some universal and some means-tested benefits. This suggests that allocation of resources and eligibility criteria set within countries, as well as informal care, are likely to be more important in determining access to formal social care than any particular system of care delivery. 

\subsection{Access to Social Care - Social Theory of Eligibility}\label{subsubsec:eligibility-theory}

\setlength{\epigraphwidth}{0.8\textwidth}
\epigraph{"...the \textit{criteria} under which a given individual is eligible for publicly funded support for long-term care, and for how much support the individual is eligible, and the \textit{processes} involved in selecting from the general population those who receive this support and determining for how much support each person is eligible"}{\textit{[Eleftheriades and Wittenberg, 2013, pp.2}}

Two social theories on how eligibility for public services are determined will be discussed in this subsection; street-level bureaucracy and candidacy.

The term street-level bureaucracy is generally credited to Michael Lipsky and his book of the same name [-@RN174], along with its more recent revision [@RN430]. The theory investigates the extent to which front-line public service workers exercise discretion in which individuals of the general public are eligible to access any given service - doing so from a position of authority [@RN430]. As a result, street-level bureaucrats control, "...the nature, amount, and quality of benefits and sanctions provided by their agencies." [@RN430, pp.13]. Using the term, "street-level" suggests that the theory is concerned with power, where it resides, and who wields it [@RN428]. Street level bureaucrats can be teachers, police officers, nurses, social workers, or any other worker providing a public service [@RN428] and their "...decisions..., the routines they establish, and the devices they invent to cope with uncertainties and work pressures effectively \textit{become} the public policies they carry out" [@RN430, pp.xiii]. 

\textbf{something more on the substance here? One of Lipsky’s key points is about how bureaucrats use their discretion, making moral judgements of ‘deservingness’, rather than need – or in addition to need. And result is that some groups tend to lose out - NB}

Evans[-@RN424] and Ellis [-@RN426] both provide a critique of street-level bureaucracy that suggests the theory needs to be augmented to take into account new structures of public services, particularly in social work, that place greater autonomy with managers than front-line workers. They argue that these new structures mean workers who deal face-to-face with public service users have less discretion about eligibility criteria and are more likely to have to justify eligibility decisions to senior members of staff who now wield more power in terms of service access. 

\textbf{is that why these restrictions were introduced? In order to damp down autonomy of street level b.s and achieve more standardised outcomes? NB}

Empirically exploring the effects of street-level bureaucracy poses a number of methodological problems [@RN428]. The use of large sample surveys of public sector workers investigating their views and how they make decisions is one way (e.g. [@RN427]). However Lipsky [-@RN430] and Hupe et al [-@RN428] agree that qualitative interview techniques with public sector workers in their own workplace is the best way to fully understand how street-level bureaucracy impacts on front-line services. 

The term "candidacy" was first used by Dixon-Woods et al [-@RN438; -@RN437] to form a concept of how vulnerable individuals identified themselves as being eligible for a particular health service or intervention given for particular illnesses or health conditions. The theory was further explored and augmented by Mackenzie et al [-@RN84; -@RN434]  in relation to access and utilisation of all public services as a way to explore concerns about unequal distribution of uptake. 

The theory argues that there are a number of social and cultural factors that contribute to an individual's interpretation of their eligibility for a given service and is based on a seven-stage model as shown in Table \ref{tab:candidacy}

\begin{table}[h]

\end{tabular}%
}
\caption{Seven stage model of candidacy}
\label{tab:candidacy}
\end{table}

This is a much broader theory than that of street-level bureaucracy and focusses on the barriers and enablers individuals face/use when accessing services but in other respects it is trying to do the same thing - exploting how front-line interactions shape outcomes. \textit{Do previous authors make this point? Seems obvious for them to have considered how their frameworks relate. Is it true to say that candidacy brings the service user’s subjectivity into the picture (albeit constrained) as well as that of the bureaucrat? - NB} It could be argued that candidacy includes the concept of street-level bureaucracy in the third, fifth, and sixth stages of the model shown in table \ref{tab:candidacy}. "professional decision making" and "offers of and resistance to services" are areas where an interface between a service user and service professional takes place - much like the interactions described by Lipsky. 

Investigating candidacy as a theory empirically again appears to be best served using qualitative methods. The complex and dynamic nature of candidacy suggests identifying meaningful quantitative measures are unlikely. Both Dixon-Woods et al [-@RN438; -@RN437] and Mackenzie et al [-@RN84; -@RN434] employed critical interpretive synthesis in their studies. 

Both of the social theories described in this subsection deal with the concept of eligibility and how, in the case of street-level bureaucracy, professionals exercise discretion on access to service and, in the case of candidacy, how service-users identify whether they are eligible and offer themselves for a service in the first place. Both theories describe complex interactions between individuals across an eligibility criteria barrier. The next section describes in detail this eligibility barrier in relation to social care in the UK, firstly from a Scottish perspective and then more broadly in the wider UK.  

\subsection{Access to Social Care - Eligibility in Scotland and the UK}\label{subsubsec:eligibility-uk}

\epigraph{"It is through the eligibility criteria that resources are rationed, that is "need" is equated with "resources available". This mechanism severely limited the idea that provision could be determined either by need or by the right to services."}{\textit{[Sharkey, 2006, pp.10]}}

In Scotland, access to social care is needs-tested via assessment carried out by a social worker. The criteria for social care delivery, therefore, has a very important part to play in how services are accessed. 

In 2010 the Scottish Government published a report  written in conjunction with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities\ (COSLA) [@RN171] and included the recommendation that the National Eligibility Framework developed by the Sutherland review into free personal and nursing care [-@RN172] should be applied across all social care services. The framework has four criteria for assessing risk in relation to a person’s care needs: critical, substantial, moderate and low [@RN184]. The critical and substantial levels of risk indicate social care needs should be addressed immediately or imminently, whereas a moderate level of risk may indicate either some or no services being required. There is \textit{no explicit description} of severity or which care needs fall into each category and in practice each local authority sets the criteria and decides at which level of risk they will provide social care [@RN170] and thus has a big influence on how individuals can access social care services.

Equity of access to services is directly influenced by an eligibility framework. Indeed, the strategy for self-directed support [@RN171, pp.20] acknowledges this and states that such a framework “…can result in resources being narrowly focused on individuals with acute needs.” However, the report goes on to state that growing demand and finite resources requires some form of eligibility assessment but this should not have a disproportionate effect on any one group of people requiring care.

The eligibility framework allows each local authority to set thresholds for access to care in line with local priorities and resources. This has the effect that access to services varies across differing council areas. The potential for regional variation is again acknowledged by the strategy for self-directed support [@RN171, pp.20] which states that, “…further work will be undertaken by the Scottish Government and COSLA to assess whether there is merit in establishing national thresholds for access to formal support across all client groups.”

Acknowledgement of problems with eligibility criteria and the promise of “further work” to be undertaken by the Scottish Government and COSLA is repeated in practitioner guidance on Self-Directed Support published in 2014 [@RN170, pp.19] and that , “…it remains the case that local authorities should operate eligibility criteria to determine whether or not an individual assessed as having social care needs can access formal support and if so, which of their needs are to be met by that support.”

Data is not available on levels of care provided by LAs for each of the National Eligibility Framework criteria or for the threshold that each LA provides care at. The Scottish Government collects an annual report of eligibility and waiting times for the first quarter of the year. A recent report [@RN184] provides information on the time individuals had to wait to receive assessment and the time individuals had to wait to receive care in the period January-March for the preceding five years. However, no absolute numbers of people in each category is provided.

The Scottish National Eligibility Framework has striking similarities to that formerly used in England and described in Fair Access to Care Services (FACS) produced by the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE) [-@RN138]. Exactly the same nomenclature is used to describe the eligibility categories of need. Newton and Browne [-@RN163] critiqued a previous version the FACS guidance and found similar issues to those raised above regarding regional variations in service and concentration of services on those with the highest need. Their paper describes further issues with access to social care in the context of social theory described by Lipsky [-@RN174] and “street-level bureaucracy” (discussed in section \ref{subsubsec:eligibility-theory}) where intentional and unintentional judgement of entitlement by social care workers have an impact on whether an individual receives care or not \textit{add it to the above section also}. Newton and Browne [-@RN163] also make the assertion that health and social care has never been accessed equitably by arguing that those with a greater ability to articulate needs and negotiate access are more likely to gain access to services \textit{Link to Candidacy}. Although no citation is provided to back-up this argument, it has certainly been described elsewhere [@RN118] and sits well in the broader discussion of inequitable access to services [@RN116; @RN175; @RN120].

In England, the Care Act [-@RN176] aimed to reduce regional variations in eligibility in access to social care by imposing national minimum thresholds that local authorities would have a statutory obligation to provide. The Care Act also aimed to ensure local authorities provided care, “…as early as possible to help maintain well-being and independence, and potentially delay a situation where longer-term care and support might be required.” [@RN169, pp.2]. The minimum criteria for being eligible for care involves an individual having needs that impairs their ability to meet two or more of a designated list of outcomes (e.g. managing and maintaining nutrition or maintaining hygiene) [@RN169] and is set by the Secretary of State for Health [@RN177].

In practice, the most likely outcome is that the minimum threshold that local authorities will have to provide care will be similar to the “critical” level of the National Eligibility Framework previously used in the FACS guidance [@RN173; @RN177] (and similar to that used in Scotland). This will legalise a shift that has already been occurring in England where fewer numbers of LAs are providing care for those with “moderate” needs and only providing care for those with “critical” needs [@RN173; @RN177]. Burchardt et al. [-@RN173] state that only 2% of English LAs will have to widen their care threshold whereas 12% could now, legally, tighten care provision as a result of the Care Act. \textit{This situation is not new and has been gradually worsening over the past decade and has profound impacts on the quality of, and access to, social care [@RN374]}\textbf{re-write Sharkey is 2006 makes no sense temporally - also spell out what "profound impacts" are}.

A recent report by the House of Commons Communities and Local Government Committee [-@RN287] confirmed reductions in the absolute number of people receiving care, the concentration of services in those with highest needs only, reduction in quality of care provided, and the resulting pressures this caused to the health service through increased emergency admissions and delayed discharges. The report highlights the perilous state of social care provision in England and urges immediate attention from the government to address funding shortfalls. 

Burchardt et al. [-@RN173] and Abrahams et al. [-@RN177] recognise some positive changes to social care policy through the Social Care Act but are damning about past UK government social care policy in England and Wales. They cite chronic underfunding and cuts for over ten years resulting in fewer numbers of people receiving care at a time when demand is sharply increasing due to demographic change. The “intensification” of services on those with the most acute needs is cited by both sets of authors as counter-productive – ignoring those with moderate care needs completely derails one of the main purposes of the Care Act, preventative services. Indeed, \begin{quotation}
	“As well as lacking in moral sense, such an approach is economically unsound. Waiting for people to have high needs before providing care means that care will be more expensive, as well as pushing more older people into an already pressurised NHS” \end{quotation} [@RN177, pp.5].

A similar picture has been seen in Scotland. Absolute numbers of people receiving home care has steadily fallen over the last 10 years whilst the number of hours of care provided has increased [@RN128]. There are wide variations in the number of hours of home care provided per population across local authorities [@RN449; @RN128]. This may reflect different demographic make-up of each local authority although reductions in ratios per population can be seen in almost all local authorities [@RN128]. Audit Scotland [-@RN449] also highlighted that intensifying services is likely to be a short-term solution with negative long-term impacts and suggests comparison of performance across Scotland would be beneficial in identifying good practice. 

In a report profiling the care at home sector in Scotland, MacLeod and Mair [-@RN147] describe large decreases in absolute numbers of people receiving care at home over the ten years to 2013. There have also been significant reductions in the number of people receiving non-personal care (so called “mopping and shopping”). The increase in the number of hours of home care delivered by all services reflects a focus on smaller numbers of individuals with higher care needs. This means those with moderate or low personal care needs and those requiring “mopping and shopping” services are now less likely to receive publicly funded care. Echoing the views of Burchardt et al. [-@RN173] and Abrahams et al. [-@RN177], Macleod and Mair [-@RN147] highlight the potential false economy of this situation – home care services are likely to reduce the need for costly emergency admissions to hospital and delay the requirement for more intensive home care packages.

\subsection{Access to Social Care - Social Theory of Resource allocation}\label{subsubsec:theory-resources}

\epigraph{"Almost all public expenditure on the social services in Britain benefits the better off to a greater extent than the poor"}{\textit{[Le Grand, 1989, pp.3]}}

In his seminal book, "The strategy of equality", Julian Le Grand [-@RN175] investigated whether social and economic equality had been achieved since the introduction of post-war welfare spending. The book compares the distribution of public expenditure and outcomes across health, education, housing, and transport. It concludes, as highlighted in the quote above, that those with higher socioeconomic position benefited disproportionately from government social services spending across all sectors. Indeed , "...there persist substantial inequalities in public expenditure, in use, in opportunity, in access and in outcomes"[@RN175, pp.4].

Criticism of Le Grand's conclusions cites subsequent research that shows empirical evidence indicating a reduction in inequalities and questions the assumption that the sole purpose of the welfare state is to achieve equality [@RN113]. More recent research [@RN440 cited in ; @RN116],[@RN441; @RN115] has shown that when comparing distribution of resources at neighbourhood level (rather than national level) there is higher spending in less affluent areas. However some service were found to be "pro-rich" (education, pensions) and others "pro-poor" (parks, environmental services) [@RN440 cited in; @RN116]. Whether a service is more likely to be used by more or less affluent citizens is important in terms of resource allocation - particularly when services are being cut as shown by Gannon et al [-@RN235] and discussed further in section \ref{subsubsec:resources-scot}. 

Understanding why there are differences in resource allocation for different types of service has led to the investigation of "middle class capture" of services and how it is obtained [@RN442; @RN118; @RN116]. An adapted version of Gal's [-@RN442] six channel framework of middle class advantage described by Hastings et al [-@RN116] is shown in table \ref{tab:gal}

\begin{table}[h]

    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{%

\caption{Six channels of middle class advantage}
\label{tab:gal}
\end{table}

These six "channels" conceptualise the modes of how and why welfare spending in certain areas appears to benefit more affluent groups. In their study investigating street-cleansing services, Hastings et al [-@RN116] observed the influence of middle class capture and some of the channels of advantage described in table \ref{tab:gal} suggesting the theories of Le Grand [-@RN175], described above, and Tudor-Hart, described below, should not be discounted.

ICL

There has been no research on whether the inverse care law is perceptible in social care - a service delivered, like primary care, in a community setting and also likely to have an impact on secondary health care use. \textit{(But also perhaps influenced by access to primary care? I’m speculating here but if GPs can exercise any influence in getting people assessed (and hence allocated service), then places with better access to GPs then likely to have an advantage in access to social care - NB) - look to NICE MM and SC} Nor has any research specifically investigated variations in the distribution of social care services by socioeconomic position at the local level. Such research would add useful evidence to the debate regarding the strategy of equality and middle class capture. 

The next section describes how social care is funded in Scotland and how cuts to services post-2008 may adversely impact less affluent members of the public. 


\subsection{Access to Social Care - Resource Allocation in Scotland}\label{subsubsec:resources-scot}

Local authorities in Scotland have a statutory obligation to provide social care to individuals they have assessed as eligible for care [@RN449]. All local authority funding is provided by the Scottish Government via a block general revenue grant made up of a number of components textit{(Re-write - rememeber Tax and charges)} [@RN448; @RN445]. The majority of this grant is calculated via a formula known as the Grant Aided Expenditures (GAE) which accounts for over 80% of the general revenue grant [@RN450]. The formula for GAE is calculated using what is called a "client group approach" and is based on  89 services provided by local authorities [@RN450]. A national figure for each service is set and each local authority receives a percentage of that figure based on estimates of the number of people that use that service (a capitation) and other secondary indicators such as area deprivation or rurality [@RN450; @RN444]. For example, funding for primary school teachers is based on the number of children in primary education (primary indicator) and adjusted to take into account the percentage of pupils in small schools (secondary indicator) [@RN450]. 

The use of formulae to allocate public expenditure has potential to improve efficiency in spending and equity of distribution [@RN444]. Equity of distribution is achieved via the explicit nature of a formula framework with transparent methodology that can be debated and amended [@RN444]. The formula for the "green book" settlement was agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) [@RN448]. However, as King et al [-@RN445] note, GAE grants to local authorities are estimates of relative, rather than absolute, spending needs in that area. The "green book" reporting the annual settlement for local authorities in Scotland stresses that the values allocated for different services are not budgets or targets and that local authorities are free to spend resources (other than ring-fenced monies) as they see fit [@RN450]. In effect, "...the capitation payments seek to offer comparable public sector organisations the opportunity to deliver some average level of service, assuming average responses to social and economic circumstances, and an average level of efficiency" [@RN444, pp.309].

The "green book" outlines seven main areas of local authority expenditure from which the 89 services mentioned above are derived; Education, Social Work, Roads \& Transport, Leisure \& Recreation, Cleansing \& Environment, Elections \& Taxation, and Other Services [@RN450]. Spending allocation for social care comes under the social work heading which is subdivided into 23 subcategories of services. Of these, nine are directly related to social care as defined for the purposes of this thesis (the others being based on e.g. children's services);

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item service for home based elderly
\item residential accommodation for the elderly
\item casework and related administration: elderly
\item services for people with disabilities
\item casework and related administration: people with disabilities
\item independent living fund
\item carers support and respite services
\item care home fees
\item personal and nursing care for older people
\end{itemize}

The expenditure for the first three items in this list as well as carers support \& respite services and care home fees are calculated using population weighted indices for each local authority calculated from; the standardised mortality ratio, census data on self-report long term illness \& people living alone, as well as pension credit data service for home based elderly) or council tax data (residential accommodation for the elderly). Services relevant to people with disabilities and the independent living fund are calculated depending on the number of people aged 16-64 in each local authority. Expenditure allocation for personal and nursing care for older people is derived from formulae calculated in the Scottish Government Health Directorate Distribution [@RN450].

The GAE formula has been in place for some time (initially outlined in 1992 [@RN450]). The more recent issue facing local authorities in terms of finance has been cuts following the 2008 financial crash. In the financial year 2016/17 the overall grant to Scottish local authorities was cut in real-terms by 5% which added to a cumulative real-term cut of 11% since 2010/11 [@RN447]. Authorities have been managing this pressure by reducing spending in all areas of their budgets - with the exception of social work [@RN447]. £3.1 billion was spent on social work by Scottish local authorities in 2014/15 - an increase of 3% since 2010/11 and a third of all council spending [@RN446]. However, given the 5% decrease planned for 2016/17 Audit Scotland [-@RN447] warn that social work (and specifically social care) budgets are now likely to be cut, which will likely result in a decrease in the quality of service [@RN446]. 

These budgetary pressures are difficult for local authorities to manage, but what is the outcome on service users? Using the "pro-rich/pro-poor" nomenclature initially used by [@RN440] (and discussed in section \ref{subsubsec:theory-resources}), Gannon et al [-@RN235] investigated the social impact of spending cuts in Scotland. The report found that the vast majority of local authority spending is on services that are "pro-poor" i.e. services that are disproportionately used by people with lower socioeconomic position. As a result, despite attempts to protect these services,  the cuts to local authority spending have a disproportionate effect on this societal group. Councils with higher numbers of the most deprived citizens are having to make the biggest percentage cuts in services defined as "very pro-poor" (e.g. social work for children and families or citizen's advice). These findings echoed an earlier report from the project looking at cuts across the UK as a whole [@RN117]. 

Gannon et al's report [-@RN235] assigns older persons social work services as "pro-poor" along with local authority public transport but does not distinguish between the two in analysis. It is therefore difficult to dis-aggregate the specific effect of cuts on social care from the report particularly, as shown above, as there was an increase in spending between 2010/11 and 2014/15. Nevertheless, cuts expected to social care budgets from 2016/17 [@RN447] are also likely to have a disproportionate effect on those with lower socioeconomic position. 

Cuts to services reduce the potential for access to such services. If these cuts are disproportionately affecting more deprived communities it is likely unequal outcomes for these communities will be exacerbated. Given the close link of social care to health care, the question of whether social care influences health inequalities is important. The next section presents an overview of literature on health inequalities.

\subsection{Summary}\label{subsec:access-sc-summary}

There is no agreed standard definition of social care, a term often used synonymously is long-term care. The boundary between what is health care and what is social care is often blurry. The definition chosen for this thesis provided by Colombo et al [@RN414] encapsulates the wide number of services that make-up social care including nursing, personal, equipment, and technological. The definition also identifies that social care can be provided not only at home, but also in institutions or other community settings. 

Three broad models of social care are seen internationally; universal, mixed, and means-tested schemes. Within each of these models there are many different methods of delivery across countries and no easy comparison can be made identifying differences in outcomes across countries. It does appear that universal systems spread the risk of the costs of social care more equitably among the populations where it is employed. Importantly, every model of social care involves some user-contribution towards costs. 

Eligibility for social care is determined via pre-specified criteria in all cases. How these criteria are set varies greatly across and within countries. In UK terms eligibility criteria are set by local authorities and have been greatly tightened in recent years as a response to budgetary constraint. Also observed is the process of "intensification" where greater hours of social care are being delivered to smaller numbers of people with higher needs. This has potential to erode an important function of social care - preventing expensive unscheduled health care use. 

Eligibility for social care can also be affected by the individual in need, and those applying the pre-determined criteria. Social theories regarding this include "street-level bureaucracy" and "candidacy". Both theories describe difficulties that may exist in individuals attempting to access public provided services, the latter in more detail and including aspects of the former. Both theories are best suited to being investigated with qualitative methods.

Allocation of resources for social care in Scotland are decided by local authorities. The monies they receive are dependent on a grant from the Scottish Government which is calculated via the GAE formula. The GAE formula allocates money for social care services based on a mixture of data from each local authority including; mortality and morbidity ratios, the amount of people living alone, and the ratio of people paying certain level of tax or receiving certain benefits. This formula has been in place for over 20 years and was agreed with COSLA.

Social theories regarding allocation of resources for public service suggest those with higher socioeconomic position are more likely to benefit from public spending than their less affluent peers. Empirical analysis of;  "The strategy of equality", "The inverse care law", and "middle class capture" all suggest more affluent groups are better at accessing public services. 

There have been significant cuts to local authority budgets across the UK since 2008. Savings have been made whilst trying to protect front-line services but current and future cuts are likely to impact these services. Most local authority spending is on services used by those from lower socioeconomic positions thus cuts will disproportionately affect these people. Little is known about how access to social care differs across socioeconomic and geographic strata. In an age of austerity, the question of whether an inverse \textit{social} care law exists remains unanswered. 



\section{Health and Social Care Interaction}\label{sec:hsc-interaction}

*edit this*

Internationally, provision of social care has become one of the most important issues for policy makers in recent years [@RN406; @RN250] \textit{Context, Trump, Korea, ISIS etc). Some of the key principles of health and social care integration legislation in Scotland are aimed at improving care for those with multiple long-term health conditions - also known as multimorbidity [@RN266; @RN251]. In Scotland, approximately two-thirds of individuals receiving social care services are over the age of 65 [@RN128] whilst approximately two-thirds of all those over the age of 65 have multimorbidity [@RN33]. 

It would seem intuitive that a large proportion of those receiving social care have multimorbidity. However, no single data source exists that allows this comparison to be made. Nevertheless, guidelines exist for healthcare professionals to assist in assessing the social care needs of older people with multiple long term conditions [@RN150]. Multimorbidity is associated with a number of negative outcomes including increased health care usage [@RN226]. Whether multimorbidity increases use of social care services is unknown but this could have an important role in informing policy decisions regarding social care provision. 

\subsection{Public Policy}\label{subsec:policy}

\epigraph{Scotland "... is a paradoxical tapestry of rich resources, inventive humanity, gross inequalities, and persistent levels of disadvantage"}{\textit{[Christie, 2011, pp.2]}}

Acknowledging demand for public services was likely to increase, the Scottish Government set up the Christie Commission on the future delivery of public services in 2010. In its final report [@RN451], the commission made a number of pertinent observations including:- 

\textit{Consider dropping bullets and describing in paragraphs}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Increasing demand for public services are due not only to demographic reasons but also because of a failure to tackle inequality
\item Spending levels on public services is unlikely to return to 2010 levels until 2026
\item Public services in 2010 were fragmented with no coordination and often different services duplicated work
\item Public services had a "top-down" approach to delivery with institutional and professional needs given precedence over users
\end{itemize}

The recommendations of the commission included:- 

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Better coordination and integration of public services
\item Empowerment of communities in how services are structured
\item Reduction in demand for services by focussing on prevention
\item Improving performance and efficiency of services
\end{itemize}

These recommendations had profound effects on subsequent policy and legislation in Scotland, most notably in relation to health and social care services [@RN451], although this was not the first policy aimed at improving coordination between these services.  Previous policies aiming to increase cooperation between NHS health boards and local authority provided social care included; the Joint Future Group [-@RN452], the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act [-@RN453], Community Health Partnerships [2002], and the Integrated Resource Framework [@RN454]. 

2011 also saw the publication of the Scottish Government vision to achieve sustainable quality in the delivery of healthcare services by the year 2020 [@RN457]. Echoing some of the Christie Commission recommendations, the 2020 vision contained a number of objectives to change the way health and social care services are delivered including; a focus on prevention and self-management of health conditions, an expanded role for GPs and primary care, a focus on reducing hospital stays \& providing treatments in a community setting, improving care for those with multimorbidity, and formally integrating health and social care services [@RN251]. 

The inclusion of the last of these objectives - to formally legislate for the integration of health and social care - was in response to the fact that that although previous policies had made some  progress in improving co-ordination between health and social care services, this had not had a demonstrable impact on outcomes for users of these services [@RN458; @RN252; @RN369]. This was often as a result, among other things, of different cultures in health and social care organisations [@RN458]. The difference in culture is perhaps understandable given the very different ways health and social care have been historically funded and delivered.

Health care in Scotland, like the rest of the UK, is provided via the NHS free at the point of need to all citizens [@RN456]. This principal has remained in place despite many internal changes of structure (with some divergence from other parts of the UK)[@RN456]. Front-line services are delivered by 14 geographically-based health boards [@RN456]. 

Provision of social care is the responsibility of the 32 Scottish local authorities who also either provide the services themselves, purchase provision through third-party private or voluntary organisations, or give individuals a budget to purchase provision themselves [@RN456]. As discussed in section \ref{sec:access-sc}, this service is not universal and depends on a needs-test against set eligibility criteria. Means-testing is employed to determine user-contribution to non-personal and non-nursing care institutional care home costs. 

Given such contrasting backgrounds, and most importantly separate silos of funding sources and budgets, integration of services had many barriers [@RN456]. Building on the 2020 vision [@RN457] objective of integrating health and social care, legislation to enact this structural change into law was announced in 2011. Section \ref{subsec:hsc-integration} describes these changes in more detail.

\subsection{Health and Social Care Integration}\label{subsec:hsc-integration}

\epigraph{"Our vision is that by 2020 everyone is able to live longer healthier lives at home, or in a homely setting. We will have a healthcare system where we have integrated health and social care, a focus on prevention, anticipation and supported self-management. When hospital treatment is required, and cannot be provided in a community setting, day case treatment will be the norm. Whatever the setting, care will be provided to the highest standards of quality and safety, with the person at the centre of all decisions. There will be a focus on ensuring that people get back into their home or community environment as soon as appropriate, with minimal risk of re-admission."}{\textit{[Scottish Government, 2011, pp.2]}}

The Public Working(Joint Bodies) (Scotland) Act [@RN459] paved the way for the legal integration of health and social care services and all integrated authorities had management and structural plans in place by the Scottish Government's designated deadline of 1st April 2016. These reforms are seen as the "...most significant change to the way we care for and improve the health of our people, in their communities, since the creation of the NHS" [@RN461].

One of the most important changes this legislation made was that funding for the designated integrated services were to be provided from a single budget. In  a report investigating future change to health and social care services in England, the Barker commission noted, "...moving to a single budget with a single commissioner is not a sufficient condition to tackle the myriad problems of integration that face health and social care. But we believe it is a necessary one" [@RN460, pp.9].

Integration is expected to ensure; better outcomes, more efficient use of resources, reduction in hospital and residential long term care use, a shift in care closer to people's homes, and avoidance of the consequences of fragmented & uncoordinated care [@RN252; @RN251; @RN234; @RN232; @RN455; @RN266]. However, despite streamlining of budgets, there remain significant barriers in achieving these aims [@RN252; @RN251]. 

One of the key principles of the legislation is that health and social care is delivered under one of two models - the body corporate or lead agency model. The former sees the delegation of budgets from a health board and one or more local authorities to an Integrated Joint Board (IJB). This board is responsible for the delivery of care and develops a strategic plan for how services will be implemented [@RN455; @RN232; @RN366]. The IJB consists of representatives from the health board, local authority/authorities, health professionals, social work professionals, voluntary sector workers, unpaid carers, and service users [@RN252;@RN232]. The full extent of integrated services delegated to the IJB varies from area to area but as a minimum adult social care services, adult community health services, and some adult acute health services (particularly those that incur lots of emergency admissions) are delegated [@RN455; @RN252; @RN232; @RN366]. The IJB decides how the delegated budgets will best achieve the aims of the strategic plan for the area and directs the NHS board and local authority/authorities to provide services according to this plan[@RN252; @RN366]. 

Under the lead agency model, a plan is made to divide the delivery of specific health and social care services to either the NHS board or a local authority [@RN455; @RN252; @RN232; @RN366]. Funding for these services is transferred between the health board and local authority as agreed in a delivery plan [@RN252; @RN366]. The lead agency plan between NHS Highland and Highland Council is the only one in place in Scotland - all other areas favouring the body corporate model [@RN455; @RN252; @RN232; @RN366]. Under this plan, NHS Highland is responsible for the delivery of all adult health and social care services, whilst the council takes responsibility for children's community health and social care services [@RN232; @RN366]. 

Comparison of outcomes between the Highland partnership and all other IJBs will be of significant interest. One of the main aims of integration is to reduce unscheduled healthcare use, in particular unplanned admissions to hospital, which can be an indicator of a lack of social care support in an area [@RN455; @RN252; @RN251]. There are other key performance indicators that have been set nationally as a way to audit the improvements (or lack thereof) made over time. These are focussed on outcomes on individuals and include self-report of health and wellbeing questions from surveys and statistics collected from routine data on service use [@RN465; @RN464; @RN366].  

Early indicators suggest that integration authorities are still some way from making an impact on the delivery of services. In a report published immediately prior to IJBs taking control of services Audit Scotland [-@RN252] suggested that disagreements over budgets, poor workforce planning, difficult to understand governance arrangements, and poor planning around involvement of the charity and private sectors meant that little improvement was likely to be seen in 2016/17.  

\subsection{Research on Health and Social Care Interaction}\label{subsec:research}

\epigraph{"There is tentative evidence that financial integration can be beneficial. However, robust evidence for improved health outcomes or cost savings is lacking"}{\textit{[Weatherly et al, 2010 pp. 3]}}

\textbf{Add in "Where is the NHS going wrong?" here}
\textbf{? also need to add in Witham et al} [@RN132]


The large scale structural change in health and social care services seen in Scotland and further afield is built on the expectation that more efficient social care provision can help reduce unplanned health care use. Although intuitive there is very little robust evidence to suggest this is the case [@RN367; @RN234; @RN233; @RN362; @RN260; @RN366; @RN467; @RN369]. \textbf{clarify - refs predate Scottish integration - what were they measuring??}

Much research has been conducted on the \textit{structural} elements of integration with little emphasis on \textit{outcomes} for service users [@RN141]. There has also been little attention paid to those who deliver front-line services, indeed, ".. a preoccupation with the process and mechanisms of joint working has diverted attention away from the central role played by the professions, who appear sceptical of the aims of these initiatives and distrustful of their professional colleagues" [@RN467, pp.12]. 


The lack of evidence around outcomes may be partially due to the difficulty in collecting data that can measure the interaction between health and social care services. A recent report for the OECD [-@RN406] highlighted the paucity of good data regarding social care, even in countries known to have good data resources. The report also suggests that use of routine administrative data may be a useful tool in addressing this lack of evidence [@RN406]. A small number of studies have been published in the last decade using linked-administrative data to look specifically at interactions between health and social care services. 

Porter et al [-@RN462], using Welsh data, reported that aggregate statistics of social care use and emergency admission to hospital showed no correlation. However, when analysing individual-level linked administrative data, those that received social care before an emergency admission episode were more likely to have fewer subsequent admissions with shorter lengths of stay than those that received social care only after an admission. The study period covered six years of data for adults over the age of 65 from one geographic area of Wales. 

Using data from four areas in England, Bardsley et al [-@RN183] found that older persons staying in residential care homes were less likely to use unplanned hospital services compared to those receiving social care at home. The study period was based over one year only and all those that died during the year were excluded from analysis which may have had some impact on results. Intensive social care delivered at home was associated with higher unplanned \textit{and} planned secondary care use. 

In Sweden, Condelius et al [-@RN30] found that individuals using high amounts of community health \& social care services were also likely to use large amounts of emergency hospital services. This suggests community services may not reduce unplanned health care use. The study period focussed on hospital admissions over one year in the over-65 age group and found a small number of individuals with high multimorbidity had higher use of all primary healthcare, social care, and secondary care services compared to others with lower multimorbidity levels. 

In a large comprehensive study in Australia, Kendig et al [-@RN199] linked a population survey to administrative health and social care databases. The purpose of this study was to identify clusters of service users and did not specifically measure the interaction between health and social care services.  Using k-means cluster analysis, the study identified nine clusters of service utilisation - three of which accounted for the vast amount of total use. 

Differences in the systems of health and social care, data types, outcomes, and analysis techniques make it impossible to draw robust conclusions from these studies. They each demonstrate, however, that linking administrative data sources is a feasible option for this type of research and that these techniques may be able to improve understanding of the interaction between health and social care services.

\textbf{Need to synthesise this section and draw a conclusion. Also see Colin's comments in feedback word doc for section notes}

\subsection{Summary}\label{subsec:hsc-interaction-summary}

Public policy in Scotland has been edging towards greater integration of health and social care services since the devolved Scottish Parliament was set-up in 1997. A lack of progress in shifting care from secondary to community settings through policy alone prompted legislation to formalise the integration of these services - a law which came into effect on the 1st April 2016.

Almost all areas of Scotland have opted to employ a body-corporate model of integration where health boards and local authorities devolve responsibility and budgets to an Integrated Joint Board that sets local priorities and directs how services will be delivered. Early indications suggest IJBs have not yet overcome governance, budgetary, or workforce issues to make any improvements in nationally set outcome indicators. 

Very little research has been conducted into the interaction of health and social care services at the user level. Most studies and reports focus on the structural implications of integrating care instead. Novel techniques involving the linkage of administrative data sources at the individual-level are a feasible way of filling the gap in knowledge about the interaction of these services and the impacts they have on service-users. 

\section{Administrative Data Linkage}\label{sec:data-linkage}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\item Best way to empirically investigate MM + SC is through data linkage. Spiers et al. 
\item Section will briefly describe linkage
\item Also mention difficulties in obtaining data?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Context}

\epigraph{Record linkage refers to a merging that brings together information from two or more sources of data with the object of consolidating facts concerning an individual or an event that are not available in any separate record.}{\textit{[OECD, 2006]}}

Administrative data is data that is generated when individuals use a service of some description. Often in research terms, and exclusively in this thesis, administrative data refers to data generated by the use of \textit{public} services [@RN85; @RN352]. This data can describe the provision of a specific service or how it was administered by the provider [@RN85; @RN352]. As the above definition outlines, record linkage involves joining data about individuals from two or more administrative databases together [@RN279; @RN470] and is being increasingly used in social science research [@RN133; @RN276]. 

Using administrative data for research purposes has a number of advantages and disadvantages. The data is not collected for research purposes and as such may lack specific information relevant to a researcher's line of inquiry [@RN352]. This also reduces the ability of a study to adjust for all potential confounding variables, decreasing the ability to make causal inferences from analyses [@RN352]. There is the potential for ambiguity about the coding of variables in a database and what each code represents [@RN352; @RN133; @RN398] which means specialist knowledge of the database and collection methods are required [@RN352]. Administrative databases also have the potential to contain data of questionable quality and high levels of missing data [@RN540; @RN480; @RN489]. Data can be missing for the same reasons as seen in other forms of research but, in addition, individuals may also be missing due to failure to interact with a service or because insufficient information was available to accurately match records during the data-linkage process [@RN489]. 

Advantages of administrative databases are that they enable large, often population sized, sample sizes because they are generated from service use [@RN352; @RN85; @RN398]. This characteristic also reduces the potential for sampling bias [@RN352]. Well maintained administrative data can offer information over long periods of time including very recent data [@RN85]. This can make inferences from research findings more robust with excellent levels of external validity without the extra cost traditional observational studies might incur [@RN352; @RN489]. The potential to link administrative databases from a number of sources is a significant advantage and offers insights into how services interact [@RN352; @RN133; @RN398].

There are two main methods of linking data from disparate sources; deterministic matching and probabilistic matching [@RN279; @RN470; @RN491]. Where differing datasets possess common unique identifiers, deterministic matching simply links data using this identifier. Probability matching methodology can be employed in the absence of a common unique identifier [@RN279; @RN470; @RN491]. Using this method, a probability of two records matching correctly is calculated based on how well the records match based on a set of common partial identifiers such as name, date-of-birth, and postcode [@RN279; @RN470; @RN491]. An important consideration when using probabilistic linkage is making an assessment of false-positive match rates [@RN279; @RN470; @RN491]. There are three main strategies to assist with this assessment; measuring error using "gold-standard" data (such as a validated external datasets), sensitivity analyses (comparing results across differing linkage parameters), and comparing linked and unlinked data according to characteristics (such as sociodemographic subgroups) [@RN279]. 

Scotland is home to some of the best administrative databases in the world [@RN85]. This is particularly due to the high-quality of health datasets that have been collected and maintained for over 40 years [@RN85; @RN470]. Whilst linkage of differing health datasets has become common over this period, new cross-sectoral linkages are beginning to emerge such as health and educational data [@RN471], and health and social care data [@RN132]. These cross-sectoral linkages are providing new insights that have the potential to have lasting impact on policy and provision of services [@RN85; @RN133].

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:lit-review-conclusion}

Access to social care varies significantly internationally and is influenced in two main ways; allocation of resources to providers of social care, and how these providers distribute services within local areas. Eligibility criteria are the main means of how services are rationed. Demographic change has resulted in increasing demand on social care services at the same time as budgets in the UK and Scotland have been drastically cut. 

In response, new models of service delivery have been sought by governments. In Scotland, the formal integration of health and social care services has been implemented with the dual aims of increasing efficiency and quality of service. Individuals with multimorbidity are high users of both health and social care and are likely to be able to benefit most if integration achieves its aims. 

Intuitively, social care can prevent unplanned used of unscheduled health care services but there is little evidence that suggests this is the case. Lack of data, particularly on social care, has made it difficult to understand the interaction between these services. Routinely collected administrative data, along with new methods of linking records across sectors means that it is now possible to address this lack of evidence. One small study [@RN462] shows that linking individual-level health and social care data shows associations hidden in aggregate statistics. 

Measuring multimorbidity is an inexact science with variation in the methods and number of conditions used. Simple counts of diseases or medicines have been shown to be as efficacious a predictor of health care use as more complicated indices. Methods using statistical techniques to cluster regularly co-occurring health conditions may provide new insights into the social patterns of multimorbidity. *Data sources available make it difficult to measure multimorbidity as per reccommended definitions*
